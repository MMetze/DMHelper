Key things:
* Repeated "Notes" entries
* Not working import/export of items
* Bugs from email with pdf attachment



v2.0
Text Ribbon: [BUG?]  Would like to see it larger to make it more user friendly

- Campaign Tree:
    - [BUG] Internal Hyperlinking:  I don't believe the linking is working any more as far as linking matching text to entry titles
    - [?BUG?] Tree Window:  The slider at the bottom of the tree pane disappears as soon as the symbol for the lowest sub folder is exposed...
            - this can be a problem if you have entry titles that are much longer, then you cannot read them by sliding the view.
