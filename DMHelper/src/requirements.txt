fixed * Create spell gives object transparency from base shape
fixed * added effect doesn't then move with the Layer
fixed * delete effect doesn't work
fixed * line and description not on the front
fixed * line and description not publishing
fixed * grid controls not working
fixed * burning hands effect doesn't resize with grid size
fixed * Grid type should no be a button, not clickable
fixed * need to be able to change layers for effects
* Effect markers on enemies not visible
* Selection and Active markers in publish version
* Create/edit/move effect doesn't dirty
* Include "add XYZ..." to right-click context menu
* Undo-redo on drawing fow
* Party icon on map not scaled right
* Check set visibilities for different token types
* Make sure combatants disappear at zero HP, also when applying an effect
* backwards compatibility - add a grid layer only if "showGrid==1" or true
2) As far as layer functions are concerned, the grid is not visible in any way. Also, sometimes adding elements (text, video, images) via the layer edit window crashes the program. Unfortunately, I have not been able to recognize a pattern in this behavior that would allow me to speculate what the step might be that causes the program to crash.
3) Finally, a problem regarding combats. When creating a combat by assigning a map it is not visible in any way in the master window. You can see the map in the players window (however without a grid). Adding a monster shifts the view of the map in the players window by centering the view on the monster.
* Make grid button a flat pushbutton that opens its own popup menu
* Make the tooltip for a combatant or effect mention their layer

Effects
* optional set of whether effect colors are applied or not
* parent an effect to a token


Checkpoint: when adding a new attribute/item to a campaign entry, consider:
* presentation in the view
* output/input
* export/import (copy)
