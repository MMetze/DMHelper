v2.5.6
2) As far as layer functions are concerned, the grid is not visible in any way.
Also, sometimes adding elements (text, video, images) via the layer edit window crashes the program.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to recognize a pattern in this behavior that would allow me to speculate what the step might be that causes the program to crash.
3) Finally, a problem regarding combats. When creating a combat by assigning a map it is not visible in any way in the master window. You can see the map in the players window (however without a grid). Adding a monster shifts the view of the map in the players window by centering the view on the monster.
