Bugs
Typing in an entry is very slow...
Publishing text doesn't scale, animate or publish correctly
DONE Combat - Spacebar to use pointer doesn’t work. Cycles though initiative list.
DONE Map - Spacebar to use pointer doesn’t work.
DONE Pointer still doesn’t come up with spacebar and not perfectly lined up with DM screen (shows slightly up left on Player view than on DM view)
DONE Combat - New Map button doesn’t do anything.
DONE When initiative list is not sorted it will trigger a new round each time it hits a player with higher initiative also messing with lair actions. I understand it is probably coded this way for simplicity. Maybe either always auto sort or have a new round trigger only when it jumps back to the top of the list.
DONE (SLIGHTLY IMPROVED, BIGGER IMPROVEMENT NEEDS MORE EFFORT) - When adding an object to a combat encounter, the height/width/rotation fields are offset from the labels.
DONE When adding a monster to a combat map, clicking on … to get info of selected drop down monster, details window pops up behind add window and is non-intractable.
Apply Effects doesn’t apply condition effects from spells
Spells aren't showing their images, just the colors
Effects highlight players even when not active if you move players. Moving effect clears it but then reactivates on player movement. Sucks when I have a trap or status effect I don't want players to know about but gives away that something is up when their token suddenly lights up.
Map Markers
    Map Markers only 1/4 of it visible to players
    Map Marker Right click Edit and Delete doesn’t work.
    Not sure if this is a bug or should be a feature request, Map Markers cannot get small enough and gets highly pixelated Additionally text is unreadable when shrunk to appropriate size for map.
If I have several pictures for a monster (e.g. Bandit), how can I edit more than one token? If I click "edit current token", it still only opens the first picture in the list...

Mac Only
Unable to play videos.
Add Media under campaign tree and selecting a video (mp4) says not able to read image file. Seems to only support images not videos.

ENHANCEMENTS
DONE Space bar to move a map around, A-key to toggle the pointer.
NOT GOING TO DO IT Apply Effects would be nice if it roll damage and knew what kind of save/roll it was.
Dedicated effect settings dialogs for each setting type
DONE Autosave timer

NOT REPRODUCIBLE, HOW IS THIS DONE --> R Click remove mobs from initiative list crashes program.
NOT REPRODUCIBLE, HOW IS THIS DONE --> If I select no FoW at the beginning, it won’t let me add it later.
AS DESIGNED --> If a mob is visible but not known it doesn’t show up in Player view (seems like known overrides visibility if off). So when I go “and you see..” I have to click two check boxes per mob. Also I might want to have something visible but not them be aware its a mob, like an animated table for example.
NOT REPRODUCIBLE, HOW IS THIS DONE --> Grid does not display on Player Window.
USER MANUAL BUG, USE [[text here]] TO CREATE A LINK --> Auto and manual hyperlinks not working. Pg 21 of user manual.



Feature Improvements
Integrate Timer into current player window. Currently it shows up as a separate window which if maximized goes to another screen. Then moving it around causes issues. Should just overlay the current screen.
Still behaves the same way

For measuring distance if I include the height distance after measured I have to re measure. Would be nice if it auto recalculated when typed using the current measured line.
Still behaves the same way

There is no file check when importing media. If its not the right type it will either crash or display nothing.
Still behaves the same way

Character/Player initiative modifier not auto calculated from Dex modifier.
Still behaves the same way

For map grid adjustment. Would be nice to have an OBR (Owl Bear Rodeo) style grid adjuster (allow decimals and correct for distortion) as well as instead of just changing number, have the ability to drag both x and y independently bars that will live preview move the grid while overlayed on the map. (I can probably show what I mean better than explain) Secondly ability to calibrate distance to large (continent style) map distance markers.
Same

Have ability to reset Combat Statistics (also it seems to reset on its own randomly and not sure what the criteria is)
Same

Add ability to drop text/overlay on maps (Both Combat and regular Maps) for DM View only for quick notes, room numbering, etc…
Same

Add the ability to have Map Markers for Encounters or the ability to show the Map Markers already in the maps section be shown in Encounters.
Same

Add ability to show Player life total on Player Screen
Same

Add Hit Dice info on Player Sheets. (As I type this I realize multi classing might make this a bit more complicated than initially thought)
Same


There is no undo feature (even with Ctrl-Z/Cmd-Z for Mac) on text editor. I could REALLY use this… lol
Same

Give ability to change token size on the fly. (Enlarge/Shrink/etc…) After already on the map.
I noticed the change log said this was a new feature but I cant seem to find it. Maybe should move this to questions section

Would be nice to have snap to grid option as needed for tokens.
Same

Better text editor. Many settings paste that I later cannot change such as line spacing. Also if I want black text and one letter is black in the whole thing, it won’t change to black.
Same

Program forces you to do encounter based maps. I cannot have on large map with all of the mobs already pre populated and let everyone roam. If I do all of the mobs are on the initiative list by default. If I do encounter based, when players run from room to room mid combat (mine do this all the damn time the idiots…) I can’t just pull in the previously damaged person/monster into the fight by just moving them across the map or have those traps already pre set up. I would have to move them map to map and re populate mobs from other rooms on the fly. Would be nice to have a “add to/remove from initiative” option to allow for one map and bring pre-populated people in and out of fights as PCs go along. (Making a mob “known” kinda does this but still makes the list on the R crowded AF)
Same

Allow to swap icon for individual tokens. (Either to update, or if they change form, etc…)
Didn't see this in the change log but noticed you added this for Mobs!!!! Thanks! Can we do the same for players now?

Allow for distance unit edits (ft vs yards vs miles) for larger area maps.
Same

Allow for Mac pinch and zoom on touch pad.
Same

Add (or incorporate OS built in) spell check for the text would help catch mistakes.
Same

Enable Ctrl-F/Cmd-F (find/search function) would be really nice on text.
Same

Support mac keyboard shortcuts like Cmd-W to close a window.
Same

Allow manual scaling of objects. Right now it’s whole number input based. (use drag and scale instead)
Same (this might be addressed by item 12. above)

Allow for Actions for NPCs and maybe players for pop up on mouse hover over initiative list. Also be able to track NPC abilities the same way as Mobs.
DONE!!! THANKS!!!!

Allow for shapeshifting (Maybe in PC window have a drop down that will swap stats and picture and then refreshes map to show new info?
Same

Allow for companions as Beasts under PCs (I guess I could add them as additional PCs but would be nice if you bring in a player it also brings in all selected companions (selected as in the check marks next to their name) automatically with them. Also perks of calling them Beasts/Monsters is that you have actions on hover as well as hides unnecessary info such as proficiencies when looking at details. Maybe have it how NPC becomes a PC the moment they are put in a Party folder, have a beast become a companion when put in the party folder under a PC?
Same

Allow to select multiple and right click make all visible/known. Having a room full of monsters to make visible one by one is a bit of a pain.
Same

Allow reorganizing of special abilities/actions etc… in bestiary (like drag and drop)
Same

Questions
Not sure if this is a bug or a question on how am I doing this wrong. “Edit file” in the Map menu of a Map does not swap out/update the map. It seems like it sometimes does if I then restart the program afterwards but not consistently. No idea why it sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t.
Same

What does Encounter option of Map Marker do?
Same

In the Player/NPC/Party character sheet under Hit Points, what is the lower number? If it’s Max HP it stays 0 when using bestiary info. Also doesn’t limit max HP when healing. Is it Temp HP? Either way should probably display and be editable (if Temp HP) in the initiative list while in a combat map.
Same


3.2 Specific Feedback
Dropping an image comes out distorted on Player View but fine in DM view.
I noticed the program has been crashing a bit and randomly. This will suck if it happened mid game and haven't saved recently. Might be worth adding an auto save feature? I know mac has the ability to reopen programs at last known state regardless how it closed. Not sure what goes on in the code in the background but its something that I have always liked about macs vs windows apps so I assume there is a APK or something you can use to make this happen?

Things I missed above
Spell book - can't select any created spells to modify them.
Spell book - arrows on the right don't work to cycle through spells.
