Remove BattleDialogModelMonsterCombatant?

Change of pace: just thinking about what else is needed before I release that Bestiary version
Need to create a new Bestiary file and make sure it's clean for clean releases.
Test the Dickens out of replacing other bestiaries, and maybe make sure it creates a backup specifically when it tries an upgrade
Update the warning message to mention the bestiary
Prepare a messaging online to the same effect


* Move some options around
* Add search string to ruleset/campaign specifics
* Populated icon doesn't show up until changing monsters
1) There are two ruleset files, the app's one and the user's one (optional)
2) The user can decide the location for both of them in settings
3) The app will check at startup and overwrite it's one if the default file with the installation is newer than the app's file
Should be enough already, compatible with what is already there, and I can fix the current problem you have first, then add the user ruleset file

Real bugs:
Copy character doesn't set Hit Points or AC, REactions not copied (Noble), Monster Type goes to Race instead of Class, Speed?

3.4 todos:
Why does my bestiary have a whole bunch of License entries and the spellbook has none?
Generic Bestiary
    Add a repeatable string-based "element" (e.g. multiple icons)
    Transition from current to new bestiary, item by item
        "icon" as an element attribute to a sub-element, or "icon filename --> special case sub-elements, add this to characters...
        stat modifiers as separate items
        skills as a single string
        actions, legendary actions, reactions: combine damage_dice and damage_bonus to damage
    Add optional campaign-specific bestiary, what is a "private" entry in the bestiary? --> Nothing???
Test:
** Monsters
    Add monster
    Remove monster, first, middle and end of list
    Edit monster then change monster - does it store and save?
    Edit monster then close dialog - does it store and save?
    Ruleset default, new campaign, loaded campaign
** Default ruleset persists
** Copy from Monster to Character - does it generally work, check default values (e.g. size)
** Check does import/export work, for bestiary and for CHARACTERS
Generic Spellbook
Generic Conditions
Update DiceRollDialogCombatants and other places that conditions/effects are relevant
Expand spells and DiceRollDialogCombatants to automatically place the right damage amounts and saving throw type

Big Rocks
Templates
Set scale for table-top screens
Enhanced Soundboard
Multiple publish targets?
Redo documentation and demos
Many feature and intro videos
Map Library

Template things to do:
* Add Combatant dialog
* Initiative list entries
    Combatant roll-over frame
* Conditions
* "Events" in initiative, such as lair actions
* Handling legendary actions or other resettable per round enemy resources

Main 3.3.1 Todos:
Add What's New to the About dialog
Need a better Help icon, looks stupid. Maybe integrate with a dragon symbol
DONE - to be tested 1) any time the backup file is bigger than the current file or twice as small, rename it rather than replacing it, might lead to a bit of bloat, but generally the files grow and hence they extra backups would be useful
DONE - to be tested 2) add a date/timestamp to the backup names that are kept
DONE - 3) add a "open the backup folder" button
DONE - 4) add a "open the logs folders" button
DONE - 5) Combine those all into a "Help" dialog and put the links to the User Guide and Getting Started Guide in there as well

Add a refresh button to files in the options dialog
DONE - BUG: custom UI files path is wrong
NOT REPRODUCED BUG: moving an FOW texture crashes the app
DONE - BUG: New Map (in combat) button doesn't do anything - remove it
Create new map/combat dialogs
Update docs


Performance, Memory usage, Delta install, full uninstall
QImageReader::setLimit controls and improvements
Remove then sort --> crash
Scroll zoom scrolls (shouldn't)
Middle button moves


Lazy load images for Spells & Monsters
When starting with only one
Add an add Video Object button or auto-detect videos and images from the "Add Object" button
Check the tab order in the video object options dialog
Crashes when recording/using cloud effect layers
Crashes when changing the bestiary with a campaign open (e.g. effect layers)

Messed up video with Effects
Exporter should copy videos and make them local as well


Thoughts for templates:
* Issues for backwards compatibility
    Convert Notes, Equipment and Spells into HTML CDATA
    Combine level1 level2 and level3 or class1 class2 class3 into basic strings (on loading!!)
    Integrate Jack of All Trades into the skills during DnDBeyond
    Change pact magic and spell slots to be resource entities, move spell slots to a list
    Added inspiration (==> Importer)
    Check DnDBeyondID == 0 being the invalid value
    Fix overall import/export
    Fix DndBeyond import
    Fix these: <dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="conditions"/>
    Change hitdice to a multi-resource
    Added temporary hp (==> Importer)
    copy default xml and ui files with resources
    Implement Character::findKeyForSkillName and CharacteR::getWrittenSkillName
    Should known string values actually be constants rather than magic numbers?
    Fix     // HACK
* How to interpret types:
    Dice --> string to be interpreted: QString expression("(\\d*)d(\\d+)(\\+|-)*(\\d*)");
    Expertise (skill value 0, 1, 2) --> list of proficiencies/expertise?
    <dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="passiveperception"/> --> create this
* Defaults:
    Integer = 0
    String = ""
    Boolean = 0 (false)
    Resource = 0,0

Things to be mandated for templates: App to check and have default values for the template
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:string" name="_baseID"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="type"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:string" name="name"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:boolean" name="active" default="1"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:boolean" name="expanded"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="row"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:string" name="dndBeyondID" default="-1"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:string" name="icon"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="initiative"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:string" name="size" default="medium"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="armorClass" default="10"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="hitPoints" default="1"/>
<dmh:attribute type="dmh:integer" name="speed" default="30"/>

from CampaignObjectBase:
    element.attribute("expanded", QString::number(0)).toInt());
    element.attribute("row", QString::number(-1)).toInt();
    element.attribute("name");
    element.attribute("base-icon");
from Combatant
    element.attribute("armorClass").toInt());
    element.attribute("hitPoints").toInt());
    element.attribute("hitDice")));
    element.attribute("conditions", QString("0")).toInt());
    element.attribute("initiative", QString("0")).toInt());
    element.attribute("icon"));
    element.firstChildElement(QString("attacks"));

Exempted classes (can be removed with Character):
Character
CharacterFrame
ExpertiseDialog

** CLEAN UP DEAD CODE!!!


Mappings needed:
    Stats to modifiers
    Conditions
    Size to size factor



emit itemMoved second parameter
void BattleFrame::handleEffectChanged(QGraphicsItem* effectItem)
All the commented code in battleframe.cpp, layertoken.cpp, and layertoken.h
Check for // TODO: Layers comments


movement circle with release right click accidentally



Layers
* Update order/opacity/visible to hit both player and dm views
* Add opacity sliders
* Updates on Layer Dialog applied to both views immediately (token visibility not reflected)
* Scaling/positioning of layers (images/videos) of different sizes

Multiple icons for a monster
* Add ability to have multiple icons
* Add saving/loading of multiple or single icons
* Add search for multiple icons with same base name
* Add searching for multiple icons in a directory with base name
* Add handling of multiple icons in bestiary, including viewing
* Add selection of icon in add monster dialog
* Add randomization of icon as an option when adding multiple monsters


NEXT:
Fix Map initialization to differentiate videos and get a screenshot itself.

1. Videos to work (Tharky)
2. Rendering positioning to work on Mac (ongakugainochi)
3. init for maps without combat - view tab doesn'T do anything... (Encryptid) - DONE
4. Players see dead people - Loki - DONE
5. character death not updated - DONE
PCs should also be able to be made invisible (* visibility/known of PCs should also impact visibility) - DONE
DONE (TwistedDM — 04/25/2022) Not sure if this has been mentioned before (I looked but didn't see anything mentioned at least), but the latest release seems to mess with custom selection/activation icons. They display properly in the DM Window, but the player window still shows the default icons.
DONE (Loki — 05/12/2022) Another totally useless find!  Since the PC's were leveling up, I entered their new XP total as 6500.  When I went back to check them they had all been set to 0.  Entering the value as 6500 worked fine.  Would be nice to have either an error on that field or allow commas.  It doesn't seem to be used anywhere (like auto updating the Proficiency Bonus) so maybe allow both?
DONE (Loki — 05/03/2022) In 2.3 when adding monsters in combat, you could leave Hit Points blank and not check 'Use Average HP'.  This would add the monster with a simulated HP roll so when adding several monsters they could all have different HP.  In 2.4 it just seems to add them all with the average.
DONE (nubsie13 — 05/12/2022) Please forgive my ignorance, but is there a way to have the turn countdown bar appear in the initiative tracker on the player window?
DONE Combatant Frame
DONE Countdown Timer
DONE On/off
DONE Yes/No confirmation on Fill/Clear for FOW

DONE Configuration of:
   * grid width
   * grid color
   * initiative tracker icon size
   * initiative tracker text size
Fixed basic Youtube playback - DONE

Options to remove from libvlc: access_output, gui, keystore, logger, lua, text_renderer
    plus libaccess_srt_plugin.dll, libvnc_plugin.dll

Battle Frame://change to have greyscale and BW FOWs - also, switching back and forth leaves the publish icon not synced!

DONE - Effects smaller than 5ft are not rendered properly.
Effect selection is not shown


EncounterText complete import/export of extended text capabilities
EncounterTextEdit - clear needs to clear background
Fix image filters to include all images and videos
