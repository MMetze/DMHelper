Welcome to the DM Helper! We hope you enjoy using it and encourage you to stop by our Discord server and say hi: https://discord.gg/C7zPKBp


If you are having trouble because the program keeps crashing, saying something about a missing ‘MSVCP140.dll’ or 'VCRUNTIME140.dll', we can help! These are part of the Microsoft Visual Studio runtime required  to run the DM Helper. Unfortunately, MSVS is not pre-installed, so you have to download and install the (small) runtime yourself here http://bit.ly/DMH-MSVCP140
