<h2>What's New: Version 3.7</h2>

<h3>⚠️ Important Update</h3>
<p>
DMHelper has become more flexible over recent versions, with updates to character data, UI templates (v3.3), and now the Bestiary system (v3.6). As part of this, some automatic 5E rules — like ability modifiers, saving throws, and proficiency bonuses — are no longer applied by default.
</p>
<p>
If you are coming from an earlier version, DMHelper will try to update your Bestiary automatically, but please double-check your monster entries and their stats.
<b>To be safe, we recommend backing up your Bestiary and Campaign XML files before opening them.</b>
</p>

<h3>New v3.7 Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Daggerheart Support</b>: Added Daggerheart-specific SRD content, monster and character templates and an easy-access fear counter. Support for configurable movement ranges lets you run Daggerheart battles seamlessly!
<li><b>Overlay Elements</b>: Added overlays for fear, counters, timers, and audio, plus improved dropdowns with auto-completion for faster selection. Overlays are shown on the Player Window regardless of the currently published entry.
<li><b>Fog of War editing</b>: The selected Fog of War layer is now highlighted on the DM Window during editing. FoW textures with partial transparency are now supported.
<li><b>Streamlined Map and Combat Creation</b>: A new "wizard" guides users through adding maps or combats, replacing all the setup questions. Drag and drop now allows quick addition of maps, battles, media layers, tokens, and icons directly to the DM Window.
<li><b>Improved Grid and Measurement Tools</b>: A new grid sizing tool combined with automatic grid size detection makes it easier than ever to set the size of tokens. Snap-to-grid behavior applies to both player windows and measurement tools.
<li><b>Interactive Entry Preview Window</b>: Introduced the ability to pop out an interactive preview dialog for text entries.
<li><b>Monster Skinning</b>: Convert your favorite goblin into a dragon by applying a new icon to any monster.
</ul>
