<h2>What's New: Version 3.6</h2>

<h3>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ</h3>
<p>
With version 3.6, DMHelper has added more flexible Bestiary data to the already flexible character data and UI template system added to support different game systems in v3.3. In a similar fashion to the changes with characters in v3.3, some of the previously built-in 5E assumptions and math for characters, such as ability modifiers, saving throws and proficiency modifiers are no longer automatically applied.
<p>
DM Helper will try to update your Bestiary automatically, but we do encourage you to double-check your monster entries and their stats.
<p>
<b>To be 100% safe, we recommend backing up your Bestiary and Campaign XML files before opening them.</b>
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Dynamic Monsters</b>
<li><b>Upgraded Text rendering</b>
</ul>
