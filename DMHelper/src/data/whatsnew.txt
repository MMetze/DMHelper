<h2>What's New: Version 3.0</h2>

<h3>New Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Layers:</b> this is so big that it's hard to even fathom, let alone summarize. Just as a few examples, you can:
    <ul>
    <li> have multiple map levels, with their own fog of war
    <li> put monsters in groups on different layers, and hide or reveal them all at once
    <li> make individual layers partially transparent, hide them for the player or the DM (imagine a player version and DM version of a map!)
    <li> scale and shift layers relative to one another
    <li> ...and so much more...
    </ul>
<li>Monsters can have multiple tokens
<li>Duplication of monsters or effects in a battle - look for a button called... "Duplicate"
<li>Dynamic entry icons in the campaign tree
    <ul>
    <li> PC icons are now their own token
    <li> You can apply a custom icon to any entry in the tree
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Video playback is back! Just add a video layer to your entry/map/battle! DMH now also caches a screenshot of each video, so loading videos should go quite a bit quicker
</ul>
