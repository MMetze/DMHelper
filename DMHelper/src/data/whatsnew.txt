<h2>What's New: Version 3.1</h2>

<h3>Extra v3.1 Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Token Search:</b> added a new monster to your Bestiary and need a token? Click the search button in the Bestiary and find one from the Internet!
<li><b>Bestiary Token Fill:</b> have a bunch of monsters in your Bestiary without tokens and need a quick way to fill them in? Click the "Populate Bestiary Tokens" button in the options dialog and DMH will search the Internet for tokens for all your monsters missing a token!
<li><b>Token Editor:</b> turn your own images into customized tokens for your campaign, adding backgrounds or a nice frame
<li><b>Drag and Drop:</b> what is a D&D app without D'n'D? Now you can drag images onto the campaign tree to create new entries and onto a combat to create new layers or tokens!
</ul>

<p>

<h3>New v3.0 Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Layers:</b> this is so big that it's hard to even fathom, let alone summarize. Just as a few examples, you can:
    <ul>
    <li> have multiple map levels, with their own fog of war
    <li> put monsters in groups on different layers, and hide or reveal them all at once
    <li> make individual layers partially transparent, hide them for the player or the DM (imagine a player version and DM version of a map!)
    <li> scale and shift layers relative to one another
    <li> ...and so much more...
    </ul>
<li>Upgraded monster tokens
    <ul>
    <li> Monsters can have multiple tokens
    <li> Search and grab tokens from the Internet, applying effects and adding them directly to your Bestiary!
    </ul>
<li>Duplication (ie copy/paste) of monsters or effects in a battle - look for a button called... "Duplicate"
<li>Dynamic entry icons in the campaign tree
    <ul>
    <li> PC icons are now their own token
    <li> You can apply a custom icon to any entry in the tree
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Video playback is back! Just add a video layer to your entry/map/battle! DMH now also caches a screenshot of each video, so loading videos should go quite a bit quicker
</ul>
