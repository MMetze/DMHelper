<h2>What's New: Version 2.4</h2>
<h3>New Features:</h3>
<ul>

Navigate backwards and forwards through last campaign entries
Grid size and grid color are configurable

<li>What's New? This What's New Dialog! Spiffy, isn't it?
<li>Amazing new HW-accelerated Player Window rendering... lots more to come here! If you had any performance issues while publishing with previous versions, that should be a thing of the past now.
<li>All-new (and still optional) Initiative Tracker on the Player Window. Somewhat condensed and two different visualization options
<li>Moving characters, effects and objects from the Player's Window. Your players want to move their fireball around? Their spaceship? No problem!
<li>Added proper transparency support for objects and spell effects
<li>Add map markers with flexible icons
<li>Distance moved for each combatant is tracked during their turn
<li>Smooth multi-selection of combatants in battle
<li>Distance measurement added to the map view as well as combat
<li>Quick shortcut campaign notes, just hit Ctrl+Alt+N and enter a note, you can open the notes to view/edit them on the Campaign tab
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Other Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changing a map in combat leaves combatants where they are. This is really useful if the terrain changes dramatically mid-battle.
<li>Rebooted "Add Monster" dialog, with even more customization options
<li>Fixed and enhanced the Export & Import functionality, which unfortunately <u>really</u> didn't work right in v2.3
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Downside for now</h3>
<ul>
<li>The new libvlc I need to use doesn't work well yet with videos and OpenGL, so animated maps don't animate right now, they just show as their static version. I assure you it is in my own very personal interest to get this sorted out asap!
</ul>
<p>
<h3>And don't forget</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Press the magical "F" key on the Player's Window for Fullscreen mode, the only way to play!</b>
</ul>
