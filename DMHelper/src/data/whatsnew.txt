<h2>What's New: Version 2.3.4</h2>
<h3>With this version, I have two questions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Does it not work for anybody? I expect every machine out there is somehow OpenGL-enabled, but I want to be sure...
<li>What do you think? Does it make a difference? Is it smoother?
</ol>
<p>
<h3>More Feature improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Publish an entry but still look at other entries (published entry is marked in the campaign tree)
<li>Added all the Indiana Jones path entries for battles, too
<li>3 versions of the initiative list in the player's window: none, images-only and images-with-names... what do you think?
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Downsides for now</h3>
<ul>
<li>No MacOS version of this yet, I need to update it first
<li>The new libvlc I need to use doesn't work well with videos, so animated maps don't animate right now, they just show as their static version.
</ul>
