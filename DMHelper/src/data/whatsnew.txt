<h2>What's New: Version 3.5</h2>

<h3>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ</h3>
<p>
Starting with version 3.3, DMHelper has a more flexible character data and UI template system to support different game systems. As a result, some of the previously built-in 5E assumptions and math for characters, such as ability modifiers, saving throws and proficiency modifiers are no longer automatically applied.
<p>
DM Helper will try to update the math to transition to the new format, but we encourage you to double-check the PC and NPC stats.
<p>
If you are using the automatic D&D Beyond importer, it has been updated to reflect the new formats and has even gotten a few improvements along the way. We would recommend updating your D&D Beyond characters in the app.
<p>
Just to be 100% safe, we recommend backing up your campaign XML files before opening them.
