<h2>What's New: Version 3.6</h2>

<h3>⚠️ Important Update</h3>
<p>
DMHelper has become more flexible over recent versions, with updates to character data, UI templates (v3.3), and now the Bestiary system (v3.6). As part of this, some automatic 5E rules — like ability modifiers, saving throws, and proficiency bonuses — are no longer applied by default.
</p>
<p>
If you are coming from an earlier version, DMHelper will try to update your Bestiary automatically, but please double-check your monster entries and their stats.
<b>To be safe, we recommend backing up your Bestiary and Campaign XML files before opening them.</b>
</p>
