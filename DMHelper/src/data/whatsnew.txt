<h2>What's New: Version 3.2</h2>

<h3>New v3.2 Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Video Effects:</b> Last time it was cool animated layers, now you can add a video as a local effect and move it around. Same editing abilities as before. Get those Spirit Guardians swirling around the cleric
<li><b>Cloud Effects:</b> But that's not all... add a layer of animated clouds with a variety of settings to make your maps more dynamic
<li><b>Rotatable Tokens:</b> Right click on a token in a combat and rotate it to any angle you want
<li><b>Improved Character Actions:</b> PC/NPC actions can be importing from DnD Beyond, edited, inherited from creatures and show up in the mouse-over pop-up in battles. Click on an item in that pop-up to expand and see the description. No more jumping back and forth to character pages!
</ul>
