<h2>What's New: Version 3.6</h2>

<h3>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ</h3>
<p>
With version 3.6, DMHelper has added more flexible Bestiary data to the already flexible character data and UI template system added to support different game systems in v3.3. In a similar fashion to the changes with characters in v3.3, some of the previously built-in 5E assumptions and math for characters, such as ability modifiers, saving throws and proficiency modifiers are no longer automatically applied.
<p>
DM Helper will try to update your Bestiary automatically, but we do encourage you to double-check your monster entries and their stats.
<p>
<b>To be 100% safe, we recommend backing up your Bestiary and Campaign XML files before opening them.</b>
<p>

<h3>New v3.6 Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Dynamic Monster definitions</b>: It's done! Play any TTRPG you want using DMHelper from now on! Just configure your character and bestiary data to fit the game you play - or use one of the pre-configured options!
<li><b>Upgraded Text rendering</b>: More control and full layer support behind text publishing and animations... try it out!
<li><b>Skinning Monsters</b>: Need a quick orc priest? Grab an acolyte and give it a new token. Reminder: you can also create an NPC derived from monster if you want that orc priest to appear again and again OR if you just want to give acolytes a permanent option to be orc priests, add the new token in the Bestiary, and enjoy it forever!
</ul>

<p>
