<h2>What's New: Version 3.4</h2>

<h3>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ</h3>
<p>
Starting with version 3.3, DMHelper has a more flexible character data and UI template system to support different game systems. As a result, some of the previously built-in 5E assumptions and math for characters, such as ability modifiers, saving throws and proficiency modifiers are no longer automatically applied.
<p>
DM Helper will try to update the math to transition to the new format, but we encourage you to double-check the PC and NPC stats.
<p>
If you are using the automatic D&D Beyond importer, it has been updated to reflect the new formats and has even gotten a few improvements along the way. We would recommend updating your D&D Beyond characters in the app.
<p>
Just to be 100% safe, we recommend backing up your campaign XML files before opening them.
<p>

<h3>New v3.4 Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Autosaving is here!</b> The default is ON, but it can be turned off in Settings (General tab)
<li><b>Enhanced backup files:</b> an extra backup file is made any time a saved campaign file or resource file (e.g. Bestiary or Spellbook) grows by more than 20% or shrinks
<li><b>Help Dialog:</b> Links to the Discord, Getting Started and User's Guides, but also direct link buttons to open the Logs or Backup directories, which might be useful...
<li><b>Improved effects dialog</b> Slight overhaul, you can auto-delete an effect after applying damage and the application of spell effect conditions is automatic
<li><b>Distance Measurement:</b> If you add a height after the fact, the distance is automatically recalculated
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Consistent key usage:</b> "A" key to toggle the pointer and Space bar to move a map around
<li><b>Initiative list:</b> Doesn't get confused about rounds when it isn't sorted
<li>Creating a character from a monster works again
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Other Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased the default # of files in the recent files list, the number is editable in options</li>
<li>Increased the number of log files retained</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>And don't forget</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Press the magical "F" key on the Player's Window for Fullscreen mode</b>
