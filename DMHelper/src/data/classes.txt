Barbarian
A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard,
draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he
charges toward the frost giant w ho dared poach his
people’s elk herd.
A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into
the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored
elbow into the gut o f another.
These barbarians, different as they might be, are
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and
unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger
is the ferocity o f a cornered predator, the unrelenting
assault o f a storm, the churning turmoil o f the sea.
For some, their rage springs from a communion
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every
barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
feats o f strength.
P r i m a l I n s t i n c t
People o f towns and cities take pride in how their
civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if
denying one’s own nature was a mark o f superiority. To
a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
o f weakness. The strong embrace their animal naturekeen
instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.
Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls
and crowds. They thrive in the wilds o f their homelands:
the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes
live and hunt.
Barbarians come alive in the chaos o f combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,
giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A
barbarian can draw on this reservoir o f fury only a few
times without resting, but those few rages are usually
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.
A L i f e o f D a n g e r
Not every m ember o f the tribes deemed “barbarians”
by scions o f civilized society has the barbarian class. A
true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as
a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar
role as a protector o f the people and a leader in times
of war. Life in the w ild places o f the w orld is fraught
with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying
monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger
so that their people don’t have to.
Their courage in the face o f danger makes barbarians
perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a
way o f life for their native tribes, and the rootless life o f
the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some
barbarians miss the close-knit family structures o f the
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds
formed among the members of their adventuring parties.
C r e a t i n g a B a r b a r i a n
When creating a barbarian character, think about where
your character comes from and his or her place in the
world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin
for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land,
making you a stranger in the area o f the campaign?
Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier
where barbarians are common?
What led you to take up the adventuring life? W ere you
lured to settled lands by the promise o f riches? Did you
join forces with soldiers o f those lands to face a shared
threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you
out o f your homeland, making you a rootless refugee?
Perhaps you were a prisoner o f war, brought in chains to
“civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom.
Or you might have been cast out from your people
because o f a crime you committed, a taboo you violated,
or a coup that removed you from a position o f authority.
Q u i c k B u il d

th e e q u ipm e n t g r a n t e d b y y o u r b a c k g r o u n d :
• (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon
• (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon
• An explorer’s pack and four javelins
R a g e
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
aren’t w earing heavy armor:
• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws.
• When you make a melee weapon attack using
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
in the Rage Damage column o f the Barbarian table.
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
concentrate on them while raging.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
on your turn as a bonus action.
Once you have raged the number o f times shown
for your barbarian level in the Rages column o f the
Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
can rage again.
U n a r m o r e d D e f e n s e
While you are not w earing any armor, your Armor Class
equals 10 + your Dexterity m odifier + your Constitution
modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
R e c k l e s s A t t a c k
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When
you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
your next turn.
D a n g e r S e n s e
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense o f when things
nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge
when you dodge away from danger.
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.
To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or
incapacitated.
P r i m a l Pa t h
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of
your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path
o f the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end o f the
class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that
it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you
choose to end it.
I n d o m i t a b l e M i g h t
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength
check is less than your Strength score, you can use that
score in place o f the total.
P r i m a l C h a m p i o n
At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your
Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your
maximum for those scores is now 24.
Pr ima l Paths
Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace
that drives him or her toward greatness. Different
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Fa s t M o v e m e n t
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you aren’t w earing heavy armor.
F e r a l I n s t i n c t
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally
on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before
doing anything else on that turn.
B r u t a l C r i t i c a l
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
weapon damage die when determining the extra
damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level
and three additional dice at 17th level.
R e l e n t l e s s R a g e
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting
despite grievous w ounds. If you drop to 0 hit points
while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you
drop to 1 hit point instead.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC
increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
DC resets to 10.
barbarians attribute their rage to different sources,
however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where
pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as
steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of
a totem animal.
Pa t h o f t h e B e r s e r k e r
For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end-—that
end being violence. The Path o f the Berserker is a path
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter
the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos o f battle,
heedless o f your own health or well-being.
F r e n z y
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you
can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for
the duration o f your rage you can make a single melee
weapon attack as a bonus action on each o f your turns
after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
o f exhaustion (as described in appendix A).
M in d l e s s R a g e
Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or
frightened while raging. If you are charmed or
frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
suspended for the duration o f the rage.
I n t im i d a t i n g P r e s e n c e
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to
frighten someone with your menacing presence.
When you do so, choose one creature that you can see
within 30 feet o f you. If the creature can see or hear
you, it must succeed on a W isdom saving throw (DC
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier) or be frightened o f you until the end o f your
next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action
to extend the duration o f this effect on the frightened
P e r s i s t e n t R a g e
creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends
if the creature ends its turn out o f line o f sight or more
than 60 feet away from you.
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't
use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
R e t a l i a t i o n
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from
a creature that is within 5 feet o f you. you can use
your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against
that creature.
Pa t h o f t h e T o t e m W a r r i o r
The Path o f the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as
the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector,
and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you
with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your
barbarian rage.
Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be
kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for
an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit,
though exceptions exist.
Sp i r i t Se e k e r
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural
world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when
you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast
sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,
as described in chapter 10.
T o t e m Sp i r i t
At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a
totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or
acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar
adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,
teeth, or b ones o f the totem animal. At your option, you
also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent
o f your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear
totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thickskinned,
or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn
bright yellow.
Your totem animal might be an animal related to those
listed here but more appropriate to your homeland.
For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in
place o f an eagle.
Bear. While raging, you have resistance to all damage
except psychic damage. The spirit o f the bear makes you
tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
Eagle. While you're raging and aren’t wearing
heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on
opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the
Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit
of the eagle makes you into a predator w ho can weave
through the fray with ease.
Wolf, While you're raging, your friends have
advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature
within 5 feet o f you that is hostile to you. The spirit of
the wolf makes you a leader o f hunters.
A s p e c t o f t h e B e a s t
At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the
totem animal o f your choice. You can choose the same
animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
Bear. You gain the might o f a bear. Your carrying
capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift)
is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks
made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
Eagle. You gain the eyesight o f an eagle. You can
see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern
even fine details as though looking at something no
more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim
light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom
(Perception) checks.
Wolf, You gain the hunting sensibilities o f a wolf. You
can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace,
and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal
pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).
Sp i r i t W a l k e r
At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature
spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual
version o f one o f the animals you chose for Totem Spirit
or Aspect o f the Beast appears to you to convey the
information you seek.
T o t e m i c A t t u n e m e n t
At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a
totem animal o f your choice. You can choose the same
animal you selected previously or a different one.
Bear, While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet
o f you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack
rolls against targets other than you or another character
with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it
can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
Eagle. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to
your current walking speed. This benefit works only in
short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and
nothing else is holding you aloft.
Wolf. While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action
on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone
when you hit it with melee w eapon attack.


Bard
In the worlds o f D&D, words and music are
not just vibrations o f air, but vocalizations with
power all their own. The bard is a master o f song,
speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say
that the multiverse w as spoken into existence, that the
words o f the gods gave it shape, and that echoes o f these
primordial Words o f Creation still resound throughout
the cosmos. The music o f bards is an attempt to snatch
and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their
spells and powers.
The greatest strength of bards is their sheer
versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines
in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and
hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable
o f defending themselves in melee if necessary, using
their m agic to bolster their swords and armor. Their
spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than
blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging
knowledge o f many subjects and a natural aptitude
that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become
masters o f the talents they set their minds to perfecting,
from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.
L e a r n i n g f r o m E x p e r i e n c e
True bards are not common in the world. Not every
minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal
court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music
requires hard study and some measure o f natural talent
that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard
to spot the difference between these performers and true
bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across
the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the
gratitude o f audiences, much like any other entertainer.
But a depth o f knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a
touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.
Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and
their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell,
new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the
horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling.
Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a
variety o f skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost
Bard
Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient
monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged
leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind,
conjured forth by the magic o f her song—knowledge
o f the people who constructed the monument and the
mythic saga it depicts.
A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically
against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant
and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism.
The magic o f his song fortifies and emboldens them.
Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome w eaves
her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring
that her companions’ words will be well received.
Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves
magic through words and music to inspire allies,
demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create
illusions, and even heal wounds.
M u s i c a n d M a g i c
works o f magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange
places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to
accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A
bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal
experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed,
after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing
mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart
and assume heroic roles themselves.
P r o f i c ie n c ie s
Armor: Light armor
Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows,
longswords, rapiers, shortswords
Tools: Three musical instruments o f your choice
Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma
Skills: Choose any three
C r e a t i n g a B a r d
Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true
or not. Your character’s background and motivations
are not as important as the stories that he or she tells
about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane
childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that,
so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag
in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy
o f a story. Some bards acquire their magical music
through extraordinary means, including the inspiration
o f fey or other supernatural creatures.
Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a
master, following the more experienced bard until you
were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend
a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced
your musical magic? Perhaps you w ere a young runaway
or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard w ho became
your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble
child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the
clutches o f a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in
addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon
• (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer's pack
• (a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument
• Leather armor and a dagger
S p e l l c a s t i n g
You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of
reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your
spells are part o f your vast repertoire, magic that you
can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the
general rules o f spellcasting and chapter 11 for the
bard spell list.
C a n t r i p s
You know two cantrips o f your choice from the bard
spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips o f your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column o f the Bard table.
C lass Features
As a bard, you gain the following class features.
H i t P o in t s
Hit Dice: 1d8 per bard level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st
Q u i c k B u i l d
You can make a bard quickly by
following these suggestions. First,
Charisma should be your highest
ability score, followed by Dexterity.
Second, choose the entertainer
background. Third, choose the dancing lights and
vicious mockery cantrips, along with the following
1st-level spells: charm person, detect magic, healing
word, and thunderwave.
Sp e l l Sl o t s
The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure
wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.
Sp e l l s K n o w n o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H ig h e r
You know four 1st-level spells o f your choice from the
bard spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows
when you learn more bard spells o f your choice. Each of
these spells must be o f a level for which you have spell
slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell
o f 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you
can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace
it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also
must be o f a level for which you have spell slots.
Sp e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard
spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you
pour into the performance o f your music or oration.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
R i t u a l C a s t i n g
You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that
spell has the ritual tag.
Sp e l l c a s t in g Fo c u s
You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5)
as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
B a r d i c I n s p i r a t i o n
You can inspire others through stirring w ords or music.
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you
who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic
Inspiration die, a d6.
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll
the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can
wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the
Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have
only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach
certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th
level, a d 10 at 10th level, and a d l2 at 15th level.

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or
oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during
a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures w ho can
hear your performance regain hit points at the end of
the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra
1d6 hit points.
The extra hit points increase when you reach certain
levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d 10 at 13th
level, and to 1d 12 at 17th level.
B a r d C o l l e g e

a bard college o f your choice: the College o f Lore or the
College o f Valor, both detailed at the end o f the class
description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level
and again at 6th and 14th level.
E x p e r t i s e
At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
make that uses either o f the chosen proficiencies.
At 10th level, you can choose another two skill
proficiencies to gain this benefit.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability s cores o f
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
F o n t o f I n s p i r a t i o n
Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of
your expended uses o f Bardic Inspiration when you
finish a short or long rest.
C o u n t e r c h a r m
At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or
words o f power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As
an action, you can start a performance that lasts until
the end o f your next turn. During that time, you and any
friendly creatures within 30 feet o f you have advantage
on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.
The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or
silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
M a g i c a l S e c r e t s
By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge
from a w ide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells
from any class, including this one. A spell you choose
must be o f a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip.
The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are
included in the number in the Spells Known column of
the Bard table.
You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th
level and again at 18th level.
S u p e r i o r I n s p i r a t i o n
At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses
o f Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
Bard C olleges
The way o f a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each
other out to swap songs and stories, boast o f their
accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards
form loose associations, which they call colleges, to
facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.
C o l l e g e o f L o r e
Bards o f the College o f Lore know something about
most things, collecting bits o f knowledge from sources
as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales.
Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts
to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies
down, the audience members might find themselves
questioning everything they held to be true, from their
faith in the priesthood o f the local temple to their
loyalty to the king.
The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit o f beauty
and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the
tenets o f a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a
herald or advisor knows that the bard w ould rather be
honest than politic.
The college’s members gather in libraries and
sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms
and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.
They also meet at festivals or affairs o f state, where they
can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant
figures o f authority.
B o n u s P r o f i c ie n c ie s
When you join the College o f Lore at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with three skills o f your choice.
C u t t i n g W o r d s
Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to
distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and
competence o f others. When a creature that you can
see within 60 feet o f you makes an attack roll, an ability
check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to
expend one o f your uses o f Bardic Inspiration, rolling
a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number
rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use
this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before
the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability
check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its
damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if
it’s immune to being charmed.
A d d i t i o n a l M a g i c a l Se c r e t s
At 6th level, you learn two spells o f your choice from any
class. A spell you choose must be o f a level you can cast,
as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen
spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count
against the number o f bard spells you know.
P e e r l e s s Sk i l l
Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check,
you can expend one use o f Bardic Inspiration. Roll a
Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to
your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil
the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you
whether you succeed or fail.
C o l l e g e o f V a l o r
Bards o f the College o f Valor are daring skalds whose
tales keep alive the memory o f the great heroes of the
past, and thereby inspire a new generation o f heroes.
These bards gather in mead halls or around great
bonfires to sing the deeds o f the mighty, both past
and present. They travel the land to witness great
events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of
those events doesn’t pass from the world. With their
songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of
accomplishment as the heroes o f old.
B o n u s P r o f ic ie n c ie s
When you join the College o f Valor at 3rd level, you
gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and
martial weapons.
C o m b a t I n s p i r a t io n
Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.
A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you
can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon
damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack
roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction
to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number
rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll
but before knowing whether it hits or misses.
Ex t r a A t t a c k
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
B a t t l e M a g ic
At 14th level, you have mastered the art o f weaving
spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious
act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you
can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.



Cleric

Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer
on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that
spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.
Chanting a song o f glory, a dwarf swings his axe
in wide swaths to cut through the ranks o f orc s
arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with
every fo e ’s fall.
Calling down a curse upon the forces o f undeath, a
human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to
drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.
Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world
and the distant planes o f the gods. As varied as the gods
they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork o f
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with
divine magic.
H e a l e r s a n d W a r r i o r s
Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power o f
the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are
conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous
effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who
seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.
Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or
training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and
ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on
devotion and an intuitive sense o f a deity’s wishes.
Clerics combine the helpful magic o f healing and
inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder
foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of
plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven
to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will
benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on
their combat training to let them wade into melee with
the power o f the gods on their side.
D i v i n e A g e n t s
Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a
cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life o f temple
service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and
sacrifice, not by m agic and strength o f arms. In some
cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed
as a stepping stone to higher positions o f authority and
involving n o communion with a god at all. True clerics
are rare in most hierarchies.
When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually
because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals
o f the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the
walls o f civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect
their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting
rampaging orc s, negotiating peace between warring
nations, or sealing a portal that w ould allow a demon
prince to enter the world.
Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to
established temples and orders o f their faiths. A temple
might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a
position to demand it.
C r e a t i n g a C l e r i c
As you create a cleric, the most important question to
consider is which deity to serve and what principles you
want your character to embody. Appendix B includes
lists o f many o f the gods o f the multiverse. Check with
your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.
Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric's
relationship to that god. Did you enter this service
willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into
service with no regard for your w ishes? How do the
temple priests o f your faith regard you: as a champion
or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does
your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are
you striving to prove yourself worthy o f a great quest?
Q u i c k B u i l d
You can make a cleric quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest
ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution.
Second, choose the acolyte background.
C lass Features

S p e l l c a s t i n g
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and
chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.
C a n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know three cantrips o f your choice from
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips
o f your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column o f the Cleric table.
P r e p a r in g a n d C a s t in g S p e l l s
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list o f cleric spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When
you do so, choose a number o f cleric spells equal to
your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be o f a level for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom
o f 16, your list o f prepared spells can include six spells
o f 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list o f prepared spells.
You can change your list o f prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f cleric spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
S p e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
The power o f your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. You use your W isdom whenever a cleric spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
R i t u a l C a s t in g
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Sp e l l c a s t in g F o c u s
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
D i v i n e D o m a i n
Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each
domain is detailed at the end o f the class description,
and each one provides examples o f gods associated
with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other
features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at
6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
D o m a in S p e l l s
Each domain has a list o f spells—its domain spells—
that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain
description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the
number o f spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel
magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn
Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some
domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
levels, as noted in the domain description.
When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose
which effect to create. You must then finish a short or
long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your cleric spell save DC.
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level.
you can use it three times between rests. When you finish
a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y : T u r n U n d e a d
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
or hear you within 30 feet o f you must make a W isdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet o f you. It also can’t take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
D e s t r o y U n d e a d
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.
D e s t r o y U n d e a d
Cleric Level Destroys Undead of CR
5th 1/2 or lower
8th 1 or lower
11th 2 or lower
14th 3 or lower
17th 4 or lower
D i v i n e I n t e r v e n t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to
intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your
action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll
percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower
than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM
chooses the nature o f the intervention; the effect of any
cleric spell or cleric domain spell w ould be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature
again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after
you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds
automatically, no roll required.
D ivine D oma ins
In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different
aspects o f mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s
domain. All the domains over which a deity has
influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example,
the portfolio o f the Greek god Apollo includes the
domains o f Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you
choose one aspect o f your deity’s portfolio to emphasize,
and you are granted powers related to that domain.
Your choice might correspond to a particular sect
dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be
worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo,
emphasizing his influence over the Light domain,
and in a different place as Apollo A cesius (“healing”),
emphasizing his association with the Life domain.
Alternatively, your choice o f domain could simply be a
matter o f personal preference, the aspect o f the deity
that appeals to you most.
Each domain’s description gives examples o f deities
who have influence over that domain. Gods are included
from the worlds o f the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk,
Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as
from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons
o f antiquity.
K n o w l e d g e D o m a i n
The gods o f knowledge—including Oghma, Boccob,
Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth—value learning and
understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is
to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities,
or promote the practical knowledge o f craft and
invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its
secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers
that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the
secrets o f the multiverse. Followers o f these gods study
esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret
places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods
o f knowledge promote the practical knowledge o f craft
and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx,
Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

At 1st level, you learn two languages o f your choice.
You also become proficient in your choice o f two o f the
following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check
you make that uses either o f those skills.
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y :
K n o w l e d g e o f t h e A g e s
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to tap into a divine well o f knowledge. As an action,
you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have
proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y : R e a d T h o u g h t s
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a
creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the
creature’s mind to command it.
As an action, choose one creature that you can see
within 60 feet o f you. That creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the
saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until
you finish a long rest.
If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface
thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its
current emotions and what it is actively thinking
about) when it is within 60 feet o f you. This effect lasts
for 1 minute.
During that time, you can use your action to end this
effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature
without expending a spell slot. The target automatically
fails its saving throw against the spell.
P o t e n t S p e l l c a s t in g
Starting at 8th level, you add your W isdom modifier to
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
V i s io n s o f t h e Pa s t
Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions o f the
past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate
surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation
and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses
o f recent events. You can meditate in this way for a
number o f minutes equal to your W isdom score and
must maintain concentration during that time, as if you
were casting a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
Object Reading. Holding an object as you meditate,
you can see visions o f the object’s previous owner.
After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner
acquired and lost the object, as w ell as the most recent
significant event involving the object and that owner.
If the object w as owned by another creature in the
recent past (within a number o f days equal to your
Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute
for each owner to learn the same information about
that creature.
Area Reading. As you meditate, you see visions
o f recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room,
street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube),
going back a number o f days equal to your W isdom
score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about
one significant event, beginning with the most recent.
Significant events typically involve powerful emotions,
such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders,
births and funerals. However, they might also include
more mundane events that are nevertheless important
in your current situation.
L i f e D o m a i n
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive
energy—one o f the fundamental forces o f the universe—
that sustains all life. The gods o f life promote vitality
and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of
death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim
influence over this domain, particularly agricultural
deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun
gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods
B o n u s P r o f ic ie n c y
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain
proficiency with heavy armor.
D is c ip l e o f L if e
Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
effective. Whenever you use a spell o f 1st level or higher
to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y : P r e s e r v e L if e
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to heal the badly injured.
As an action, you present your holy symbol and
evoke healing energy that can restore a number o f hit
points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any
creatures within 30 feet o f you, and divide those hit
points among them. This feature can restore a creature
to no more than half o f its hit point maximum. You can’t
use this feature on an undead or a construct.
B l e s s e d H e a l e r
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on
others heal you as well. When you cast a spell o f 1st
level or higher that restores hit points to a creature
other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the
spell’s level.
D iv in e St r ik e
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your w eapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each o f your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
Su p r e m e H e a l in g
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll
one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you
instead use the highest number possible for each die.
For example, instead o f restoring 2d6 hit points to a
creature, you restore 12.
L i g h t D o m a i n
Gods o f light—including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus,
Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and
Re-Horakhty—promote the ideals o f rebirth and
renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the
symbol o f the sun. Some o f these gods are portrayed
as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun
o f healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal,
Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and
community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

5th beacon o f hope, revivify
7th death ward, guardian o f faith
9th mass cure wounds, raise dead
B o n u s C a n t r i p
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the
light cantrip if you don’t already know it.
Wa r d in g F l a r e
Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between
yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked
by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see,
you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on
the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker
before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded
is immune to this feature.

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing
radiant damage to your foes.
As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any
magical darkness within 30 feet o f you is dispelled.
Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of
you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level
on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature that has total cover from you
is not affected.

Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate
an aura o f sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you
dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in
a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your
enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving
throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.
N a t u r e D o m a i n
Gods o f nature are as varied as the natural w orld
itself, from inscrutable gods o f the deep forests (such
as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to
friendly deities associated with particular springs and
groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a
whole and might serve one o f these deities, practicing
mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in
their own secret tongue. But many o f these gods have
clerics as well, champions who take a more active role
in advancing the interests o f a particular nature god.
These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that
despoil the w oodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful,
or wither the crops o f those w ho anger their gods.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke
the name o f your deity. Each beast or plant creature that
can see you within 30 feet of you must make a W isdom

Gods o f trickery—such as Tymora, Beshaba,
Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and
Loki—are mischief-makers and instigators who stand
as a constant challenge to the accepted order among
both gods and mortals. They’re patrons o f thieves,
scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their
clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing
pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing
captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer
subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than
direct confrontation.

this feature again.
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y : In v o k e D u p l i c i t y
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to create an illusory duplicate o f yourself.
As an action, you create a perfect illusion of
yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your
concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you
can see within 30 feet o f you. As a bonus action on your
turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space
you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet o f you.
For the duration, you can cast spells as though you
were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own
senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion
are within 5 feet o f a creature that can see the illusion,
you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature,
given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y : C l o a k o f Sh a d o w s

poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level,
the extra damage increases to 2d8.

range o f 120 feet.
W a r D o m a i n
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of
ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with
acts o f cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of
excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war
watch over warriors and reward them for their great
deeds. The clerics o f such gods excel in battle, inspiring
others to fight the good fight or offering acts o f violence
as prayers. Gods o f war include champions o f honor
and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-
Jolith) as well as gods o f destruction and pillage (such
as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of
conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and
Maglubiyet). Other w ar gods (such as Tempus, Nike,
and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war
in all its manifestations and supporting w arriors in any
circumstance.

Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf

Crouching out o f sight on a high tree branch in the

Swinging a blade formed o f pure fire, a half-elf
charges into a mass o f skeletal soldiers, sundering
the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the
mocking semblance o f life.
Whether calling on the elemental forces o f nature or
emulating the creatures o f the animal world, druids are
an embodiment o f nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury.
They c laim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see
themselves as extensions o f nature’s indomitable will.
P o w e r o f N a t u r e
Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and
other magical powers either from the force o f nature
itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a
mystic spirituality o f transcendent union with nature
rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others
serve gods o f wild nature, animals, or elemental forces.
The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called
the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship o f gods in
temples and shrines.
Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—
the power o f tooth and claw, o f sun and moon, o f fire
and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal
forms, and some druids make a particular study o f this
practice, even to the point where they prefer animal
form to their natural form.
P r e s e r v e t h e B a l a n c e
For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The
four elements that make up a w orld—air, earth, fire,
and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element
were to gain power over the others, the world could be
destroyed, drawn into one o f the elemental planes and
broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids
oppose cults o f Elemental Evil and others who promote
one element to the exclusion o f others.
Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological
balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need
for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in
opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in
nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including
aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers)
and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids
sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially
when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.
Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or
watching over regions o f unspoiled nature. But when a
significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance
or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active
role in combating the threat, as adventurers.
C r e a t i n g a D r u i d
When making a druid, consider why your character has
such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character
lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was
raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths
o f a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic
encounter with the spirits o f nature, coming face to
face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the
experience. Maybe your character was born during an
epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted
as a sign that becoming a druid
was part o f your character’s destiny.
Have you always been an adventurer
as part o f your druidic calling, or did you
first spend time as a caretaker o f a sacred
grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was
befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in
hopes o f finding a new h ome or purpose.

Drawing on the divine essence o f nature itself, you

At 1st level, you know two cantrips o f your choice from

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have

S a c r e d P l a n t s a n d Wo o d
A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder,
ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,
willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a
spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or
sprigs o f mistletoe.
Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects,
such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death
and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might
be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak
with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole
weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields.
Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown
weapons, such as darts or javelins.
Druids from regions that lack the plants described here
have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For
instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca
tree and cactus plants.
one spell). The spells must be o f a level for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a W isdom
o f 16, your list o f prepared spells can include six spells
o f 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list o f prepared spells.
You can also change your list o f prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f druid
spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at
least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
S p e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid
spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and
attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to
magically assume the shape o f a beast that you have
seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Your druid level determines the beasts you can
transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At
2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast
that has a challenge rating o f 1/4 or lower that doesn’t
have a flying or swimming speed.
Be a s t S h a p e s
Level Max. CR Limitations Example
2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf
4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile
8th 1 — Giant eagle
You can stay in a beast shape for a number o f hours
equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then
revert to your normal form unless you expend another
use o f this feature. You can revert to your normal
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You
automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to
0 hit points, or die.
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of
the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality,
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You
also retain all o f your skill and saving throw proficiencies,
in addition to gaining those o f the creature. If
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has
any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
• When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit
points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal
form, you return to the number o f hit points you had
before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
result o f dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to your normal form. For example, if you
take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit
point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as
the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form
to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or
take any action that requires hands is limited to the
capabilities o f your beast form. Transforming doesn’t
break your concentration on a spell you’ve already
cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that
are part o f a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve
already cast.
• You retain the benefit o f any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them if the new
form is physically capable o f doing so. However, you
can’t use any o f your special senses, such as darkvision,
unless your new form also has that sense.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground in your space, merges into your new form, or
is w orn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,
but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new
form to wear a piece o f equipment, based on the creature’s
shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change
size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that
the new form can’t w ear
must either fall to the
ground or merge with it.
Equipment that merges
with the form has no
effect until you leave
the form.
D r u i d C i r c l e
At 2nd level, you choose to
identify with a circle o f druids:
the Circle o f the Land or the Circle o f the Moon, both
detailed at the end o f the class description. Your choice
grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores
o f your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an
ability score above 20 using this feature.
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield
causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that
pass, your body ages only 1 year.
B e a s t S p e l l s
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many o f your druid
spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You
can perform the somatic and verbal components o f a
druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to
provide material components.
A r c h d r u i d
At 20th level, you can use your W ild Shape an unlimited
number o f times.
T im e l e s s B o d y
Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic
components o f your druid spells, as well as any material
components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a
spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape
and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

o f this druidic society, though some individuals are so
isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking
members o f the society or participated in druidic
gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and
sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids
sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.
At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that
share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the
way o f the druid.
C i r c l e o f t h e L a n d
The Circle o f the Land is made up o f mystics and sages
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through
a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred
circles o f trees or standing stones to whisper primal
secrets in Druidic. The circle’s w isest members preside
as the chief priests o f communities that hold to the Old
Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers o f those folk.
As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced
by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s
mysterious rites.
B o n u s C a n t r i p
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one
additional druid cantrip of your choice.
N a t u r a l R e c o v e r y
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some o f your
magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing
with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended
spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your
druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be
6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until
you finish a long rest
For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can
recover up to two levels w orth of spell slots. You can
recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
C ir c l e Sp e l l s
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with
the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and
9th level you gain access to circle spells connected
to the land where you became a druid. Choose that
land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain,
swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated
list o f spells.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell
is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can
also pass through nonmagical plants without being
slowed by them and without taking damage from them if
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against
plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede
movement, such those created by the entangle spell.
N a t u r e ’s W a r d
When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or
frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to
poison and disease.
N a t u r e ’s Sa n c t u a r y
When you reach 14th level, creatures o f the natural
world sense your connection to nature and become
hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature
attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save,
the creature must choose a different target, or the attack
automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature
is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
The creature is aware o f this effect before it makes its
attack against you.
C i r c l e o f t h e M o o n
Druids o f the Circle o f the Moon are fierce guardians
o f the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to
share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest
parts o f the wilderness, where they might go for weeks
on end before crossing paths with another humanoid
creature, let alone another druid.
Changeable as the moon, a druid o f this circle might
prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops
as an eagle the next day, and crash through the
undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing
monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.
C o m b a t W i l d S h a p e
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the
ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action,
rather than as an action.
Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild
Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one
spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level o f the spell
slot expended.
C ir c l e Fo r m s
The rites o f your circle grant you the ability to transform
into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd
level, you can use your W ild Shape to transform into a
beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore
the Max. CR column o f the Beast Shapes table, but must
abide by the other limitations there).
Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast
with a challenge rating as high as your druid level
divided by 3, rounded down.
P r im a l St r ik e
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as
magical for the purpose o f overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
E l e m e n t a l W il d S h a p e
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape
at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an
earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.
T h o u s a n d Fo r m s
By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter
your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the
alter self spell at will.
D r u i d s a n d t h e G o d s
Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but
most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities
worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix
B include many such deities). The worship of these deities
is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths
of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of
Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it
claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers,
and others who live closely with nature. This tradition
includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond
personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory,
the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna,
and Ulaa.
In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms,
druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a
single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms,
for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus,
Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury:
Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are
often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and
most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy
of veneration.
The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely
unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of
the other religions of the world. They believe that every living
thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind,
fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are
a means to communicate with and command these spirits.
Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies
about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other
and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example,
believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature,
the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the
Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the
world from the incursion of aberrations.
Fighter
A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield
before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An
elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers
the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite
bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the
best advantage.
A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between
the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly
blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor,
swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles
the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own
tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with
blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing
forth to smite him.
All o f these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most
diverse class o f characters in the worlds o f D u n g e o n s &
D r a g o n s . Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an
unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a
thorough knowledge o f the skills o f combat. And they
are w ell acquainted with death, both meting it out and
staring it defiantly in the face.
W e l l - R o u n d e d S p e c i a l i s t s
Fighters learn the basics o f all combat styles. Every
fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes
in a net with some degree o f skill. Likewise, a fighter is
adept with shields and every form o f armor. Beyond that
basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
certain style o f combat. Some concentrate on archery,
some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some
on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This
combination o f broad general ability and extensive
specialization makes fighters superior combatants
on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
T r a i n e d f o r D a n g e r
Not every m ember o f the city watch, the village militia,
or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most o f these troops are
relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic
combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers,
trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar
figures are fighters.
Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as
adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
other dangerous work common among adventurers is
second nature for a fighter, not all that different from
the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks,
perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in
the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic
flame tongue sword, for example.
C r e a t i n g a F i g h t e r
As you build your fighter, think about two related
elements o f your character's background: Where did
you get your combat training, and what set you apart
from the mundane warriors around you? Were you
particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a
mentor, perhaps because o f your exceptional dedication?
What drove you to this training in the first place? A
threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need
to prove yourself might all have been factors.
You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s
army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.
Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested.
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits
o f life on a farm, or are you following a proud family
tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and
armor? They might have been military issue or family
heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years
to buy them. Your armaments are now among your
most important possessions—the only things that stand
between you and death’s embrace.
Q u i c k B u il d
You can make a fighter quickly by following these
suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your
highest ability score, depending on whether you
want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or
finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be
Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the
Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose
the soldier background.

F i g h t i n g S t y l e
You adopt a particular style o f fighting as your specialty.
Choose one o f the following options. You can’t take a
Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later
get to choose again.
A r c h e r y
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with
ranged w eapons.
D e f e n s e
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
D u e l in g
When you are wielding a melee w eapon in one hand and
no other w eapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon.
G r e a t W e a p o n F ig h t in g
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee w eapon that you are wielding with
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must
have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain
this benefit.
P r o t e c t io n
When a creature you can see attacks a target other
than you that is within 5 feet o f you, you can use your
reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You
must be w ielding a shield.
T w o -W e a p o n F ig h t in g
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add
your ability modifier to the damage o f the second attack.
S e c o n d W i n d
You have a limited well o f stamina that you can draw on
to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use
a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d 10 + your
fighter level.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or
long rest before you can use it again.
A c t i o n S u r g e
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your
normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take
one additional action on top o f your regular action and a
possible bonus action.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or
long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th
level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.
M a r t i a l A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to
emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose
Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed
at the end o f the class description. The archetype you
choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th,
10th, 15th, and 18th level.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th,
14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score o f your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores o f your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead o f
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
The number o f attacks increases to three when you
reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach
20th level in this class.
I n d o m i t a b l e
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that
you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you
can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
You can use this feature twice between long rests
starting at 13th level and three times between long rests
starting at 17th level.
M ar t ia l A rchetypes
Different fighters choose different approaches to
perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype
you choose to emulate reflects your approach.
C h a m p i o n
The archetypal Champion focuses on the development
o f raw physical power honed to deadly perfection.
Those who model themselves on this archetype combine
rigorous training with physical excellence to deal
devastating blows.
Im p r o v e d C r i t i c a l
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd
level, your weapon attacks sco re a critical hit on a
roll o f 19 or 20.
R e m a r k a b l e A t h l e t e
Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency
bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or
Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use
your proficiency bonus.
In addition, when you make a running long jump, the
distance you can cover increases by a number o f feet
equal to your Strength modifier.
A d d i t io n a l F ig h t in g St y l e
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the
Fighting Style class feature.
Su r v iv o r
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle o f resilience in
battle. At the start o f each o f your turns, you regain hit
points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you
have no more than half o f your hit points left. You don’t
gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
B a t t l e M a s t e r
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master
employ martial techniques passed down through
generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic
field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such
as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter
absorbs the lessons o f history, theory, and artistry
that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but
those who do are well-rounded fighters o f great skill
and knowledge.
C o m b a t Su p e r io r i t y
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you
learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called
superiority dice.
Maneuvers. You learn three maneuvers o f your
choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below.
Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You
can use only one maneuver per attack.
You learn two additional maneuvers o f your choice
at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new
maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you
know with a different one.
Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice,
which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you
use it. You regain all o f your expended superiority dice
when you finish a short or long rest.
You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one
more at 15th level.
Saving Throws. Some o f your maneuvers require
your target to make a saving throw to resist the
maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated
as follows:
Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
St u d e n t o f W a r
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of
artisan’s tools o f your choice.
K n o w Y o u r E n e m y
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute
observing or interacting with another creature outside
combat, you can learn certain information about its
capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if
the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard
to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
Su p e r io r C r i t ic a l
Starting at 15th level, your w eapon attacks score a
critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
• Strength score
• Dexterity score
• Constitution score
• Armor Class
• Current hit points
• Total class levels (if any)
• Fighter class levels (if any)
Im p r o v e d C o m b a t Su p e r io r i t y
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At
18th level, they turn into d l2 s .
R e l e n t l e s s
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and
have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1
superiority die.
M a n e u v e r s
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
Commander’s Strike. When you take the Attack
action on your turn, you can forgo one o f your attacks
and use a bonus action to direct one o f your companions
to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature
who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die.
That creature can immediately use its reaction to make
one w eapon attack, adding the superiority die to the
attack’s damage roll.
Disarming Attack. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to
attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item
o f your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority
die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops
the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
Distracting Strike. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to
distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You
add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The
next attack roll against the target by an attacker other
than you has advantage if the attack is made before the
start o f your next turn.
Evasive Footwork. When you move, you can expend
one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the
number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
Feinting Attack. You can expend one superiority die
and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing
one creature within 5 feet o f you as your target. You
have advantage on your next attack roll against that
creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the
attack’s damage roll.
Goading Attack. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to
attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add
the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and
the target must make a W isdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack
rolls against targets other than you until the end of
your next turn.
Lunging Attack. When you make a melee weapon
attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die
to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit,
you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
Maneuvering Attack. When you hit a creature with
a w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority
die to maneuver one o f your comrades into a more
advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the
attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature
who can see or hear you. That creature can use its
reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking
opportunity attacks from the target o f your attack.
Menacing Attack. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to
attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority
die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must
make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is
frightened o f you until the end o f your next turn.
Parry. When another creature damages you with a
melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one
superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you
roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
Precision Attack. When you make a weapon attack
roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority
die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver
before or after making the attack roll, but before any
effects o f the attack are applied.
Pushing Attack. When you hit a creature with
a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority
die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the
superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the
target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up
to 15 feet away from you.
Rally. On your turn, you can use a bonus action and
expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve o f one
o f your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly
creature w ho can see or hear you. That creature gains
temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll +
your Charisma modifier.
Riposte. When a creature misses you with a melee
attack, you can use your reaction and expend one
superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against
the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the
attack's damage roll.
Sweeping Attack. When you hit a creature with a
melee w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority
die to attempt to damage another creature with the
same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet
o f the original target and within your reach. If the
original attack roll w ould hit the second creature, it
takes damage equal to the number you roll on your
superiority die. The damage is o f the same type dealt by
the original attack.
Trip Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon
attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt
to knock the target down. You add the superiority die
to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or
smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a
failed save, you knock the target prone.
E l d r i t c h K n i g h t
The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial
mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of
magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar
to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study
on two of the eight schools o f magic: abjuration and
evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight
additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal
damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s
reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively
small number o f spells, committing them to memory
instead o f keeping them in a spellbook.
Sp e l l c a s t in g
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial
prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10
for the general rules o f spellcasting and chapter 11 for
the w izard spell list.
Cantrips. You learn two cantrips o f your choice from
the w izard spell list. You learn an additional w izard
cantrip o f your choice at 10th level.
Spell Slots. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table
shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one o f these
spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s level or
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you
can cast shield using either slot.
Spells Known o f 1st-Level and Higher. You know
three 1st-level w izard spells of your choice, two o f which
you must choose from the abjuration and evocation
spells on the wizard spell list.
The Spells Known column o f the Eldritch Knight
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more w izard
spells o f 1st level or higher. Each o f these spells must be
an abjuration or evocation spell o f your choice, and must
be o f a level for which you have spell slots. For instance,
when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one
new spell o f 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can
come from any school o f magic.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can
replace one o f the w izard spells you know with another
spell o f your choice from the wizard spell list. The
new spell must be o f a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell,
unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
or 20th level.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for your w izard spells, since you learn your
spells through study and memorization. You use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a w izard spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
W e a p o n B o n d
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical
bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform
the ritual over the course o f 1 hour, which can be done
during a short rest. The w eapon must be within your
reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion o f which
you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you
can’t be disarmed o f that w eapon unless you are
incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence,
you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your
turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
You can have up to two bonded w eapons, but can
summon only one at a time with your bonus action.
If you attempt to bond with a third w eapon, you must
break the bond with one o f the other two.
W a r M a g ic
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to
cast a cantrip, you can make one w eapon attack as a
bonus action.
E l d r i t c h St r ik e
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon
strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that
creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw
it makes against a spell you cast before the end of
your next turn.
A r c a n e C h a r g e
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30
feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use
your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the
additional action.
Im p r o v e d Wa r M a g ic

M o n k
Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail o f arrows,
a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself
into the massed ranks o f hobgoblins on the other side.
She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and
sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.
Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos
settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orc s
reach him, he exhales and a blast o f fire roars from his
mouth, engulfing his foes.
Moving with the silence o f the night, a black-clad
halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and
emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a
stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free o f its clothwrapped
scabbard and peers through the open window
at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip o f sleep.
Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their
ability to magically harness the energy that flows in
their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display
o f combat prowess or a subtler focus o f defensive ability
and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
T h e M a g i c o f K i
Monks make careful study o f a magical energy that most
monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element
o f the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically,
the element that flows through living bodies. Monks
harness this power within themselves to create magical
effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities,
and some o f their special attacks can hinder the flow o f
ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel
uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes.
As they gain experience, their martial training and their
mastery o f ki gives them more power over their bodies
and the bodies o f their foes.
T r a i n i n g a n d A s c e t i c i s m
Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes o f the w orlds
o f D&D, tiny refuges from the flow o f ordinary life,
where time seems to stand still. The monks w ho live
there seek personal perfection through contemplation
and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery
as children, sent to live there when their parents died,
when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in
return for some kindness that the monks had performed
for their families.
Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding
population, secluded from anything that might impede
their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation,
emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the
command o f their leader, a noble patron, or some other
mortal or divine power.
The majority o f monks don’t shun their neighbors,
making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and
exchanging their service for food and other goods. As
versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their
neighbors from monsters or tyrants.
For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving
a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer.
This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t
undertake it lightly. Those w ho leave their cloisters take
their w ork seriously, approaching their adventures as
personal tests o f their physical and spiritual growth.
As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are
driven by a desire to accomplish a greater m ission than
merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.
C REATING A M O N K
As you make your monk character, think about your
connection to the monastery where you learned your
skills and spent your formative years. Were you an
orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did
your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude
for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter
this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed?
Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?
Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery
choose you for a particularly important mission beyond
the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of
some violation o f the community’s rules. Did you dread
leaving, or w ere you happy to go? Is there something
you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you
eager to return to your home?
As a result o f the structured life o f a m onastic
community and the discipline required to harness ki,
monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

U n a r m o r e d D e f e n s e
Beginning at 1st level, while you are w earing no armor
and not w ielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your
Dexterity m odifier + your Wisdom modifier.
M a r t i a l A r t s
At 1st level, your practice o f martial arts gives you
mastery o f combat styles that use unarmed strikes and
monk w eapons, which are shortswords and any simple
melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or
heavy property.
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed
or wielding only m onk weapons and you aren’t wearing
armor or w ielding a shield:
• You can use Dexterity instead o f Strength for the
attack and damage rolls o f your unarmed strikes and
monk weapons.
• You can roll a d4 in place o f the normal damage
o f your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die
changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the
Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
• When you use the Attack action with an unarmed
strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make
one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if
you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff,
you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus
action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus
action this turn.
Certain monasteries use specialized forms o f the
monk weapons. For example, you might use a club
that is two lengths o f w o od connected by a short chain
(called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a
monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided
for the weapon in chapter 5.
Ki
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to
harness the mystic energy o f ki. Your access to this
energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your
monk level determines the number o f points you have,
as shown in the Ki Points column o f the Monk table.
You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.
You start knowing three such features: Flurry o f Blows,
Patient Defense, and Step o f the Wind. You learn more
ki features as you gain levels in this class.
When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until
you finish a short or long rest, at the end o f which you
draw all o f your expended ki back into yourself. You
must spend at least 30 minutes o f the rest meditating to
regain your ki points.
Some o f your ki features require your target to make
a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving
throw DC is calculated as follows:
Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
F l u r r y o f B l o w s
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your
turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed
strikes as a bonus action.
Pa t i e n t D e f e n s e
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a
bonus action on your turn.
St e p o f t h e W in d
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash
action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump
distance is doubled for the turn.
U n a r m o r e d M o v e m e n t
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you are not w earing armor or w ielding a shield.
This bonus increases when you reach certain monk
levels, as shown in the Monk table.
At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling
during the move.
M o n a s t i c T r a d i t i o n
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a
monastic tradition: the Way o f the Open Hand, the Way
o f Shadow, or the Way o f the Four Elements, all detailed
at the end o f the class description. Your tradition
grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th,
and 17th level.
D e f l e c t M i s s i l e s
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to
deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged
weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take
from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your monk level.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the
missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand
and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a
missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
ranged attack with the weapon or piece o f ammunition
you just caught, as part o f the same reaction. You make
this attack with proficiency, regardless o f your w eapon
proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon
for the attack.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores o f
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
S l o w Fa l l
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when
you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an
amount equal to five times your monk level.
E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
S t u n n i n g S t r i k e
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of
ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature
with a melee w eapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to
attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of
your next turn.
K i - E m p o w e r e d S t r i k e s
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as
magical for the purpose o f overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
E v a s i o n
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge
out o f the way o f certain area effects, such as a blue
dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you
are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you
instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving
throw, and only half damage if you fail.
S t i l l n e s s o f M i n d
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one
effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed
or frightened.
P u r i t y o f B o d y
At 10th level, your mastery o f the ki flowing through you
makes you immune to disease and poison.
T o n g u e o f t h e S u n a n d M o o n
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki o f other
minds so that you understand all spoken languages.
Moreover, any creature that can understand a language
can understand what you say.
D i a m o n d S o u l
Beginning at 14th level, your mastery o f ki grants you
proficiency in all saving throws.
Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and
fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the
second result.
During that time, you also have resistance to all damage
but force damage.
Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the
astral projection spell, without needing material
components. When you do so, you can’t take any other
creatures with you.
P e r f e c t S e l f
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki
points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
M onastic T raditions
Three traditions o f monastic pursuit are common in
the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most
monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a
few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk
according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three
traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging
as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need
choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
W a y o f t h e O p e n H a n d
Monks o f the Way o f the Open Hand are the ultimate
masters o f martial arts combat, whether armed or
unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their
opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their
bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can
protect them from harm.
O p e n H a n d T e c h n iq u e
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level,
you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness
your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one o f the
attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose
one o f the following effects on that target:
• It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be
knocked prone.
• It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you
can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
• It can’t take reactions until the end o f your next turn.
W h o l e n e s s o f B o d y
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an
action, you can regain hit points equal to three times
T im e l e s s B o d y
At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer
none o f the frailty o f old age, and you can't be aged
magically. You can still die o f old age, however. In
addition, you no longer need food or water.
E m p t y B o d y
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to
spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute.
your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you
can use this feature again.
T r a n q u i l i t y
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special
meditation that surrounds you with an aura o f peace. At
the end of a long rest, you gain the effect o f a sanctuary
spell that lasts until the start o f your next long rest (the
spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC
for the spell equals 8 + your W isdom modifier + your
proficiency bonus.
Q u i v e r in g Pa l m
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal
vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature
with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to
start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a
number o f days equal to your monk level. The vibrations
are harmless unless you use your action to end them.
To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane
o f existence. When you use this action, the creature
must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is
reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d 10
necrotic damage.
You can have only one creature under the effect o f this
feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations
harmlessly without using an action.
W a y o f S h a d o w
Monks of the Way o f Shadow follow a tradition that
values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might
be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as
spies and assassins. Sometimes the members o f a
ninja monastery are family m embers, forming a clan
sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other
monasteries are more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out
their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else
who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the
heads o f these monasteries expect the unquestioning
obedience o f their students.
S h a d o w A r t s
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you
can use your ki to duplicate the effects o f certain spells.
As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness,
darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without
providing material components. Additionally, you gain
the minor illusion cantrip if you don’t already know it.
Sh a d o w St e p
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow
into another. When you are in dim light or darkness,
as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an
unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light
or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee
attack you make before the end o f the turn.
C l o a k o f Sh a d o w s
By 11th level, you have learned to become one with
the shadows. When you are in an area o f dim light or
darkness, you can use your action to become invisible.
You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a
spell, or are in an area o f bright light.
O p p o r t u n i s t
At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary
distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a
creature within 5 feet o f you is hit by an attack made by
a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to
make a melee attack against that creature.
W a y o f t h e F o u r E l e m e n t s
You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to
harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can
align yourself with the forces o f creation and bend the
four elements to your will, using them as an extension
o f your body. Some members o f this tradition dedicate
themselves to a single element, but others weave the
elements together.
Many monks o f this tradition tattoo their bodies with
representations o f their ki powers, commonly imagined
as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants,
mountains, and cresting waves.
D i s c ip l e o f t h e E l e m e n t s
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn
magical disciplines that harness the power o f the four
elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points
each time you use it.
You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and
one other elemental discipline o f your choice, which are
detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below.
You learn one additional elemental discipline o f your
choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline,
you can also replace one elemental discipline that you
already know with a different discipline.
Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental
disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for
the general rules o f spellcasting. To cast one o f these
spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you
don’t need to provide material components for it.
Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend
additional ki points to increase the level o f an elemental
discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has
an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands
does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional
ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level
monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning
hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level
spell (the discipline’s base cost o f 2 ki points plus 1).
The maximum number o f ki points you can spend to
cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost
and any additional ki points you spend to increase its
level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the
Spells and Ki Points table.

the following effects o f your choice:
• Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect
related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of
sparks, a puff o f wind, a spray o f light mist, or a gentle

• Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or
a small campfire.
• Chill or warm up to 1 pound o f nonliving material for

Your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by
10 feet for that action, as well as the rest o f the turn.
A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of

Fist o f Four Thunders. You can spend 2 ki points to
cast thunderwave.
Fist o f Unbroken Air. You can create a blast of
compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an

and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you
choose. You can raise or lower the ice’s elevation, create
or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar.
The extent o f any such changes can’t exceed half the
area’s largest dimension. For example, if you affect a
30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high,

The worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries
and monastic traditions. In lands with an Asian cultural
flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten
Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical
traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School,
the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and
the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different
approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines
of the monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the
western lands of Faerun, particularly in places with large
Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.
Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who
teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.
In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is
made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who
maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies,
and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god
of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders
carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of
Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of
the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron
combine the study o f martial arts with a life of scholarship.
Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host.
In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to
Majere, god of meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many
monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight
and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of
mental and physical mastery.
The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of
Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god
but from dedication to the principles of their nation and their
race—the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant
to rule the world.

Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite
the dust and grime o f long travel, a human lays down
her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally
wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands,
the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide
with amazement.
A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak
making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches
an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently,
he stalks into their midst and w hispers an oath, and two

Silver hair shining in a shaft o f light that seems to
illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His
spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again

hideous darkness.
Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are
united by their oaths to stand against the forces o f evil.
Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of
a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey
beings, or in a moment o f desperation and grief with the
dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful
bond. It is a source o f power that turns a devout warrior
into a blessed champion.
T h e C a u s e o f R i g h t e o u s n e s s
A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,
to stand with the good things o f the world against the
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces o f evil
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various
aspects o f the cause o f righteousness, but all are
bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their
sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to
gods o f good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a
commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
Paladins train for years to learn the skills o f combat,
mastering a variety o f weapons and armor. Even so,
their martial skills are secondary to the magical power
they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite
the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
and those who join them in the fight for justice.
B e y o n d t h e M u n d a n e L i f e
Almost by definition, the life o f a paladin is an
adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him
or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin

evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks o f the
militias and armies o f the world, but even fewer people
can claim the true calling o f a paladin. When they do
receive the call, these w arriors turn from their former
occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes
their oaths lead them into the service o f the crown as
leaders o f elite groups o f knights, but even then their
loyalty is first to the cause o f righteousness, not to
crown and country.
Adventuring paladins take their w ork seriously. A
delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest
driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of
treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests,
and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the
cosmic balance away from oblivion.
C r e a t i n g a Pa l a d i n
The most important aspect o f a paladin character is
the nature o f his or her holy quest. Although the class
features related to your oath don't appear until you
reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading
the oath descriptions at the end o f the class. Are you a
devoted servant o f good, loyal to the gods o f justice and
honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth
to smite evil? A re you a glorious champion o f the light,
cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the
shadow, a knight w hose oath descends from traditions
older than many o f the gods? Or are you an embittered
loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done
great evil, sent as an angel o f death by the gods or driven
by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities
worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such
as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous,
Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol
Arrah, the Silver Flame,
Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty,
and Heimdall.
How did you experience your call to
serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper
from an unseen god or angel while you w ere at
prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within
you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some
terrible event—the destruction o f your home, perhaps—
drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into
a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found
yourself called to protect all such refuges o f goodness
and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest
memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost
as if you had been sent into the w orld with that purpose
stamped on your soul.
As guardians against the forces o f wickedness,
paladins are rarely o f any evil alignment. Most of them
walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your
alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest
and the manner in which you conduct yourself before
gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be
in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of
behavior that you have not yet attained.
Q u i c k B u i l d
You can make a paladin quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest
ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the
noble background.
C lass Features F i g h t i n g S t y l e
As a paladin, you gain the following class features.
H i t P o in t s
Hit Dice: 1d10 per paladin level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d 10 (or 6) + your
Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st
P r o f ic ie n c ie s
Armor: All armor, shields
Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons
Tools: None
Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma
Skills: Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation,
Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial
weapons
• (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
• (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
• Chain mail and a holy symbol
D i v i n e S e n s e
The presence o f strong evil registers on your senses like
a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly
music in your ears. As an action, you can open your
awareness to detect such forces. Until the end o f your
next turn, you know the location o f any celestial, fiend,
or undead within 60 feet o f you that is not behind total
cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) o f
any being w hose presence you sense, but not its identity
(the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).
Within the same radius, you also detect the presence
o f any place or object that has been consecrated or
desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to
1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest,
you regain all expended uses.
L a y o n H a n d s
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool
o f healing power that replenishes when you take a long
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of
hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw
power from the pool to restore a number o f hit points
to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining
in your pool.
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your
pool o f healing to cure the target o f one disease or
neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple
diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single
use o f Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately
for each one.
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
At 2nd level, you adopt a style o f fighting as your
specialty. Choose one o f the following options. You can’t
take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.
D e f e n s e
While you are w earing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
D u e l in g
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon.
G r e a t W e a p o n F i g h t in g
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you
make with a melee weapon that you are w ielding with
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll. The w eapon must have the two-handed or versatile
property for you to gain this benefit.
P r o t e c t io n
When a creature you can see attacks a target other
than you that is within 5 feet o f you, you can use your
reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine
magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules o f
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.
P r e p a r in g a n d C a s t in g Sp e l l s
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells. To cast one o f your paladin spells of
1st level or higher, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list o f paladin spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list.
When you do so, choose a number o f paladin spells
equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin
level, rounded down (minimum o f one spell). The spells
must be o f a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a
Charisma o f 14, your list o f prepared spells can include
four spells o f 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you
prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast
it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
doesn’t remove it from your list o f prepared spells.
You can change your list o f prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f paladin spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Sp e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin
spells, since their p ower derives from the strength of
your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Sp e l l c a s t in g Fo c u s
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
D i v i n e S m i t e
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a
melee w eapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell
slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to
the w eapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a
1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher
than 1st, to a maximum o f 5d8. The damage increases
by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
D i v i n e H e a l t h
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you
makes you immune to disease.
S a c r e d O a t h
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds
you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been
in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not
yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath o f Devotion,
the Oath o f the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all
detailed at the end o f the class description.
Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again
at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath
spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
O a t h Sp e l l s
Each oath has a list o f associated spells. You gain
access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath
description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you
always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against
the number o f spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the
paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin
spell for you.
C h a n n e l D i v in i t y
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel
magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided
by your oath explains how to use it.
When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose
which option to use. You must then finish a short or long
rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your paladin spell save DC.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead o f
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
A u r a o f P r o t e c t i o n
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature
within 10 feet o f you must make a saving throw, the
creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your
Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus o f +1). You
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
A u r a o f C o u r a g e
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures
within 10 feet o f you can’t be frightened while you
are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
I m p r o v e d D i v i n e S m i t e
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous
might that all your melee w eapon strikes carry divine
power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a
melee w eapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant
damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an
attack, you add this damage to the extra damage o f your
Divine Smite.
C l e a n s i n g T o u c h
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to
end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature
that you touch.
You can use this feature a number o f times equal
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum o f once). You
regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Sacred O aths
Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit
the paladin to the cause o f righteousness, an active
path o f fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken
when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination
of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this
class don’t consider themselves true paladins until
they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,
an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin’s heart.
O a t h o f D e v o t i o n
The Oath o f Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest
ideals o f justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called
cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these
paladins meet the ideal o f the knight in shining armor,
acting with honor in pursuit o f justice and the greater
good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of
conduct, and some, for better or w orse, hold the rest of
the world to the same standards. Many who swear this
oath are devoted to gods o f law and good and use their
gods’ tenets as the measure o f their devotion. They hold
angels—the perfect servants o f good—as their ideals,
and incorporate images of angelic wings into their
helmets or coats o f arms.
T e n e t s o f D e v o t io n
Though the exact w ords and strictures o f the Oath of
Devotion vary, paladins o f this oath share these tenets.
Honesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be
your promise.
Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is w ise.
Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and
punish those who threaten them. Show m ercy to your
foes, but temper it with w isdom.
Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your
honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as
much good as possible while causing the least
amount o f harm.
Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their
consequences, protect those entrusted to your care,
and obey those w ho have just authority over you.
O a t h S p e l l s
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
B r e a k in g Y o u r O a t h
A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct,
but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes
the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation
calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of
emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution
from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another
paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight
vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a
fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite o f confession and
forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no
sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.
At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be
forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps
to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the
Dungeon Master's Guide.

or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.
A u r a o f D e v o t io n
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within
10 feet o f you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
P u r i t y o f S p ir it
Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects
o f a protection from evil and good spell.
H o l y N im b u s
At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of
sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a
30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.
Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the
bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on
saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.
O a t h o f t h e A n c i e n t s
The Oath o f the Ancients is as old as the race o f elves
and the rituals o f the druids. Sometimes called fey
knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who
swear this oath cast their lot with the side o f the light
in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they
love the beautiful and life-giving things o f the world,
not necessarily because they believe in principles of
honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and
clothing with images o f growing things—leaves, antlers,
or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving
life and light in the world.
T e n e t s o f t h e A n c ie n t s
The tenets of the Oath o f the Ancients have been
preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath
emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns
o f law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

Paladin Level Spells
3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary
5th lesser restoration, zone o f truth
9th beacon o f hope, dispel magic

17th commune, flame strike
C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.
Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one
weapon that you are holding with positive energy,
using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add
your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that
weapon (with a minimum bonus o f +1). The weapon also
emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20
feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it
becomes magical for the duration.
You can end this effect on your turn as part o f any
other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying
this w eapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your
holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and
undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or
undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet o f you
must make a W isdom saving throw. If the creature
fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until
it takes damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet o f you. It also can’t take
Kindle the Light. Through your acts o f mercy,
kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light o f hope in the
world, beating back despair.
Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love,
and laughter in the world, stand against the w ickedness
that w ould swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand
against the forces that would render it barren.
Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and
laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in
your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.
Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in
despair. Let the light o f your joy and courage shine forth
in all your deeds.

can hear you must make a W isdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
move to a space within 30 feet o f you. It also can’t take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.
If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion,
shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while
it is turned.
A u r a o f W a r d in g
Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily
upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly
creatures within 10 feet o f you have resistance to
damage from spells.
At 18th level, the range o f this aura increases to 30 feet.
U n d y in g S e n t in e l
Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit
points and are not killed outright, you can choose to
drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you
can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
Additionally, you suffer none o f the drawbacks o f old
age, and you can’t be aged magically.
E l d e r C h a m p io n
At 20th level, you can assume the form o f an ancient
force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose.
For example, your skin might turn green or take on a
bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or mosslike,
or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.
Using your action, you undergo a transformation.
For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
• At the start o f each o f your turns, you regain 10 hit
points.
• Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting
time o f 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action
instead.
• Enemy creatures within 10 feet o f you have disadvantage
on saving throws against your paladin spells and
Channel Divinity options.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.
O a t h o f V e n g e a n c e
The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to
punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When
evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire
people turns against the w ill of the gods, when a thieves’
guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon
rampages through the countryside—at times like these,
paladins arise and swear an Oath o f Vengeance to set
right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins—
sometimes called avengers or dark knights—their own
purity is not as important as delivering justice.

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.
Nature’s Wrath. You can use your Channel Divinity
to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action,
you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach
for a creature within 10 feet o f you that you can see.
The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity
saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While
restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving
throw at the end o f each o f its turns. On a success, it
frees itself and the v ines vanish.
Turn the Faithless. You can use your Channel
Divinity to utter ancient w ords that are painful for fey

T e n e t s o f V e n g e a n c e
The tenets o f the Oath o f Vengeance vary by paladin, but
all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by
any means necessary. Paladins w ho uphold these tenets
are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to
mete out justice upon those w ho do evil, so the paladins
are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The
core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.
Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting

No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win

By Any Means Necessary. My qualms can’t get in the

Restitution. If my foes w reak ruin on the world, it is
because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed
by their misdeeds.

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
C h a n n e l D i v in i t y
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the
following two Channel Divinity options.
Abjure Enemy. As an action, you present your holy
symbol and speak a prayer o f denunciation, using your
Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet
o f you that you can see. That creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being
frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on
this saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1
minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened,
the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any
bonus to its speed.
On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved
for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
Vow o f Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow
o f enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet
o f you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage
on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until
it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.
R e l e n t l e s s A v e n g e r
By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close
off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an
opportunity attack, you can move up to half your
speed immediately after the attack and as part of
the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks.
S o u l o f V e n g e a n c e
Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you
speak your Vow o f Enmity gives you greater power over
your foe. When a creature under the effect o f your Vow
o f Enmity m akes an attack, you can use your reaction to
make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is
within range.
A v e n g in g A n g e l
At 20th level, you can assume the form o f an
angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a
transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following
benefits:
• Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying
speed o f 60 feet.
• You emanate an aura o f menace in a 30-foot radius.
The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or
starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must
succeed on a W isdom saving throw or become frightened
of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
Attack rolls against the frightened creature have
advantage.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

Ranger
Rough and w ild looking,
a human stalks alone
through the shadows of
trees, hunting the ores he
knows are planning a raid
on a nearby farm. Clutching
a shortsword in each hand,
he becomes a whirlwind of
steel, cutting down one enemy
after another.
After tumbling away from a cone of
freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws
back her b ow to loose an arrow at the white
dragon. Shrugging off the wave o f fear that emanates
from the dragon like the cold o f its breath, she sends
one arrow after another to find the gaps between the
dragon’s thick scales.
Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk
that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his
side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to
the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to
distract the creature while he readies his bow.
Far from the bustle o f cities and towns, past the
hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the
terrors o f the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of
trackless forests and across w ide and empty plains,
rangers keep their unending watch.
D e a d l y H u n t e r s
Warriors o f the wilderness, rangers specialize in
hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of
civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and
monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They
learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving
stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in
brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training
on techniques that are particularly useful against their
specific favored foes.
Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers
acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s
power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their
combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt.
A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly
focus on the grim task o f protecting the borderlands.
I n d e p e n d e n t A d v e n t u r e r s
Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a
guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend
the outskirts o f civilization from the ravages o f monsters
and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In
some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join
forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are
independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a
dragon or a band o f orc s attacks, a ranger might be the
first—and possibly the last—line o f defense.
This fierce independence makes rangers well suited
to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far
from the comforts o f a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced
with city-bred adventurers w ho grouse and whine about
the hardships o f the wild, rangers respond with some

mixture o f amusement, frustration, and compassion.
But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can
carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s
foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might
not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in
the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.
C r e a t in g a R a n g e r
As you create your ranger character, consider the nature
o f the training that gave you your particular capabilities.
Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds
together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you
leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—
perhaps by the same kind o f monster that became your
favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as
part o f a band o f rangers affiliated with a druidic circle,
trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You
might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature
through the necessity o f surviving in the wilds.
What’s the source o f your particular hatred o f a
certain kind o f enemy? Did a monster kill someone
you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see
too much o f the destruction these monsters cause and
commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is
your adventuring career a continuation o f your work
in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?
What made you join up with a band of adventurers?
Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways
o f the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude
that they offer?
Q u i c k B u i l d
You can make a ranger quickly by following these
suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability
score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus
on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than
Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.
C lass Features
As a ranger, you gain the following class features.
H i t P o in t s
Hit Dice: 1d 10 per ranger level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d 10 (or 6) + your
Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st
P r o f ic ie n c ie s
Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields
Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons
Tools: None
Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity
Skills: Choose three from Animal Handling,
Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception,
Stealth, and Survival
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
You are particularly familiar with one type o f natural
environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in
such regions. Choose one type o f favored terrain: arctic,
coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp,
or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or
Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your
proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that
you’re proficient in.
While traveling for an hour or m ore in your favored
terrain, you gain the following benefits:
• Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
• Your group can’t become lost except by magical
means.
• Even when you are engaged in another activity while
traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking),
you remain alert to danger.
• If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at
a normal pace.
• When you forage, you find twice as much food as you
normally would.
• While tracking other creatures, you also learn their
exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they
passed through the area.
You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th
and 10th level.
F i g h t i n g S t y l e
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style o f fighting as
your specialty. Choose one o f the following options.
You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once,
even if you later get to choose again.
A r c h e r y
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with
ranged w eapons.
D e f e n s e
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
D u e l in g
When you are w ielding a melee weapon in one hand and
no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls
with that weapon.
T w o -W e a p o n F ig h t in g
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add
your ability m odifier to the damage o f the second attack.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to
use the magical essence o f nature to cast spells, much
as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.
S p e l l S l o t s
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal
friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.
Sp e l l s K n o w n o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H ig h e r
You know two 1st-level spells o f your choice from the
ranger spell list.
The Spells Known column o f the Ranger table shows
when you learn more ranger spells o f your choice. Each
o f these spells must be o f a level for which you have
• (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor
• (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee w eapons
• (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
• A longbow and a quiver o f 20 arrows
Fa v o r e d E n e m y
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience
studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain
type o f enemy.
Choose a type o f favored enemy: aberrations,
beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey,
fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.
Alternatively, you can select two races o f humanoid
(such as gnolls and orc s) as favored enemies.
You have advantage on W isdom (Survival) checks to
track your favored enemies, as w ell as on Intelligence
checks to recall information about them.
When you gain this feature, you also learn one
language o f your choice that is spoken by your favored
enemies, if they speak one at all.
You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as
an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you
gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of
monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
N a t u r a l E x p l o r e r
spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this
class, you can learn one new spell o f 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one o f the ranger spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the ranger
spell list, which also must be o f a level for which you
have spell slots.
S p e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger
spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to
nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for
a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
R a n g e r A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive
to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at
the end o f the class description. Your choice grants
you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th,
and 15th level.
P r i m e v a l A w a r e n e s s
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and
expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on
the region around you. For 1 minute per level o f the spell
slot you expend, you can sense whether the following
types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or
within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain):
aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends,
and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’
location or number.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
L a n d ’s S t r i d e
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can
also pass through nonmagical plants without being
slowed by them and without taking damage from them if
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws
against plants that are magically created or manipulated
to impede movement, such those created by the
entangle spell.
H i d e i n P l a i n S i g h t
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating
camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh
mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally o ccurring
materials with which to create your camouflage.
Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try
to hide by p ressing yourself up against a solid surface,
such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and w ide
as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth)
checks as long as you remain there without moving or
taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a
reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain
this benefit.
V a n i s h
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a
bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by
nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
F e r a l S e n s e s
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help
you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a
creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t
impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
You are also aware o f the location o f any invisible
creature within 30 feet o f you, provided that the
creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t
blinded or deafened.
F o e S l a y e r
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter o f your
enemies. Once on each o f your turns, you can add your
Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of
an attack you make against one o f your favored enemies.
You can choose to use this feature before or after the
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
Ranger A rchetypes
The ideal o f the ranger has two classic expressions: the
Hunter and the Beast Master.
H u n t e r
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your
place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors
of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you
learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats
you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes o f orc s to
towering giants and terrifying dragons.
H u n t e r ’s P r e y
At 3rd level, you gain one o f the following features
o f your choice.
Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can w ear down
the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage
if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this
extra damage only once per turn.
Giant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within
5 feet o f you hits or misses you with an attack, you can
use your reaction to attack that creature immediately
after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
Horde Breaker. Once on each o f your turns when you
make a w eapon attack, you can make another attack
with the same weapon against a different creature that
is within 5 feet o f the original target and within range
o f your weapon.
D e f e n s iv e T a c t ic s
At 7th level, you gain one o f the following features
o f your choice.
Escape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you
are made with disadvantage.
Multiattack Defense. When a creature hits you
with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against
all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the
rest o f the turn.
Steel Will. You have advantage on saving throws
against being frightened.
M u l t i a t t a c k
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features
o f your choice.
Volley. You can use your action to make a ranged
attack against any number o f creatures within 10 feet
o f a point you can see within your w eapon’s range. You
must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and
you make a separate attack roll for each target.
Whirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a
melee attack against any number o f creatures within 5
feet o f you, with a separate attack roll for each target.
Su p e r io r H u n t e r ’s D e f e n s e
At 15th level, you gain one o f the following features
o f your choice.
Evasion. You can nimbly dodge out of the way o f
certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath
or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw
to take only half damage, you instead take no damage
if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half
damage if you fail.
Stand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature
misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction
to force that creature to repeat the same attack against
another creature (other than itself) o f your choice.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack’s damage against you.
B e a s t M a s t e r
The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship
between the civilized races and the beasts o f the world.
United in focus, beast and ranger w ork as one to fight
the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the
wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype
means committing yourself to this ideal, working in
partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.
R a n g e r ’s C o m p a n io n
At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that
accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to
fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than
Medium and that has a challenge rating o f 1/4 or lower
(appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff,
and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus
to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well
as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its
hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four
times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It
takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an
action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can
verbally command the beast where to move (no action
required by you). You can use your action to verbally
command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge,
or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature,
you can make one w eapon attack yourself when you
command the beast to take the Attack action.
While traveling through your favored terrain with only
the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by
spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast
that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type o f beast as
before or a different one.
E x c e p t io n a l T r a in in g
Beginning at 7th level, on any o f your turns when
your beast companion doesn’t attack, you can use a
bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash,
Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn.
B e s t ia l F u r y
Starting at 11th level, your beast companion can
make two attacks when you command it to use the
Attack action.
Sh a r e S p e l l s
Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting
yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with
the spell if the beast is within 30 feet o f you.
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use o f
a variety o f skills as they do to perfecting their combat
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
deception, while others refine the skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
disarming traps, and opening locks.
When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will
hurt the target most, than w ear an opponent down
with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost
supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn
magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.
A S h a d y L i v i n g
Every town and city has its share o f rogues. Most o f
them live up to the worst stereotypes o f the class,
making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and
con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized
into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty o f rogues
operate independently, but even they sometimes
recruit apprentices to help them in their scams
and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as
Rogue
S k i l l a n d P r e c i s i o n
Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps
forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear
to the door, then pulls out a set o f tools and picks the
lock in the blink o f an eye. Then she disappears into
the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick
the door open.
A human lurks in the shadows o f an alley while his
accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway,
the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate,
and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can
make a sound.
Suppressing a giggle, a gnome w aggles her fingers
and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt.
In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is
open, and she and her companions are free to make
their escape.
Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their fo e s’
vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.
They have a knack for finding the solution to just about
any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and
versatility that is the cornerstone o f any successful
adventuring party.
locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can
be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and
wererats—haunt the sewers.
As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides o f the law.
Some are hardened criminals w ho decide to seek
their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up
a life o f adventure to escape from the law. Some have
learned and perfected their skills with the explicit
purpose o f infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts
in search o f treasure.
C r e a t i n g a R o g u e
As you create your rogue character, consider the
character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a
criminal past—or present? A re you on the run from the
law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you
leave your guild in search o f bigger risks and bigger
rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures,
or some other desire or ideal?
What was the trigger that led you away from your
previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly
wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe
you w ere lucky and a successful robbery gave you the
coin you needed to escape the squalor o f your life.
Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home?
Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your
family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means
of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another
member o f your adventuring party—who showed you
new possibilities for earning a living and employing
your particular talents.

explorer’s pack
• Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools
E x p e r t i s e
At 1st level, choose two o f your skill proficiencies, or
one o f your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with
thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make that uses either o f the chosen
proficiencies.
At 6th level, you can choose two more o f your
proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain
this benefit.
S n e a k A t t a c k
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly
and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with
an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The
attack must use a finesse or a ranged w eapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another
enemy o f the target is within 5 feet o f it, that enemy
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on
the attack roll.
The amount o f the extra damage increases as you
gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack
column o f the Rogue table.
T h i e v e s ’ C a n t
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a
secret mix o f dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to
hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands
such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such
a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set o f secret signs and
symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such
as whether an area is dangerous or the territory o f a
thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the
people in an area are easy marks or w ill provide a safe
house for thieves on the run.
C u n n i n g A c t i o n
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a
bonus action on each o f your turns in combat. This
action can b e used only to take the Dash, Disengage,
or Hide action.
R o g u i s h A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate
in the exercise o f your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin,
or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end o f the class
description. Your archetype choice grants you features
at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score
o f your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores o f your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
U n c a n n y D o d g e
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to
halve the attack’s damage against you.
E v a s i o n
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out o f the
way o f certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery
breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only
half damage if you fail.
R e l i a b l e T a l e n t
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until
they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
treat a d20 roll o f 9 or lower as a 10.
B l i n d s e n s e
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are
aware o f the location o f any hidden or invisible creature
within 10 feet o f you.
S l i p p e r y M i n d
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental
strength. You gain proficiency in W isdom saving throws.
E l u s i v e
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that
attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No
attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t
incapacitated.
S t r o k e o f L u c k
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding
when you need to. If your attack m isses a target within
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
Rog uish A rchetypes
Rogues have many features in common, including their
emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in
varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes.
Your choice o f archetype is a reflection o f your focus—
not necessarily an indication o f your chosen profession,
but a description of your preferred techniques.
T h i e f
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars,
bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers,
delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using
magic items you normally couldn’t employ.
Fa s t H a n d s
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action
granted by your Cunning A ction to make a Dexterity
(Sleight o f Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to
disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action.
Se c o n d - S t o r y W o r k
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no
longer costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a running jump, the
distance you cover increases by a number o f feet equal
to your Dexterity modifier.
Su p r e m e Sn e a k
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity
(Stealth) check if you move no more than half your
speed on the same turn.
U se M a g ic D e v ic e
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the
workings o f magic that you can improvise the use of
items even when they are not intended for you. You
ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use
of magic items.
T h i e f ’s R e f l e x e s
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at
laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can
take two turns during the first round o f any combat. You
take your first turn at your normal initiative and your
second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use
this feature when you are surprised.
A s s a s s i n
You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those
who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers,
spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed
priests trained to exterminate the enemies o f their deity.
Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your
foes with deadly efficiency.
B o n u s P r o f ic ie n c ie s
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain
proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.
A s s a s s in a t e
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you
get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn
in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against
a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
I n f i l t r a t io n E x p e r t is e
Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false
identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and
25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations
for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that
belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire
appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and officiallooking
certification to establish yourself as a member of
a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate
yourself into the company o f other wealthy merchants.
Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise,
other creatures believe you to be that person until given
an obvious reason not to.
Im p o s t o r
At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly m imic
another person’s speech, writing, and behavior.
You must spend at least three hours studying
these three components of the person’s behavior,
listening to speech, examining handwriting, and
observing mannerisms.
Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a
wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have
advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make
to avoid detection.
D e a t h St r ik e
Starting at 17th level, you become a master o f instant
death. When you attack and hit a creature that is
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw
(DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency
bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your
attack against the creature.
A r c a n e T r i c k s t e r
Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills o f stealth
and agility with magic, learning tricks o f enchantment
and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and
burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a
significant number o f adventurers.
Sp e l l c a s t in g
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to
cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the w izard spell list.
Cantrips. You learn three cantrips: mage hand and
two other cantrips o f your choice from the wizard spell
list. You learn another wizard cantrip o f your choice
at 10th level.
Spell Slots. The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting
table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one o f these
spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell's level or
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm
person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast charm person using either slot.
Spells Known o f 1st-Level and Higher. You know
three 1st-level wizard spells o f your choice, two o f which
you must choose from the enchantment and illusion
spells on the w izard spell list.
The Spells Known column o f the Arcane Trickster
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells o f 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must
be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and
must be o f a level for which you have spell slots. For
instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can
learn one new spell o f 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can
come from any school o f magic.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can
replace one o f the wizard spells you know with another
spell o f your choice from the wizard spell list. The
new spell must b e o f a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell,
unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
or 20th level.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your
spells through dedicated study and memorization.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to
your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a w izard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
M a g e H a n d L e g e r d e m a i n
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast mage hand, you can
make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform
the following additional tasks with it:
• You can stow one object the hand is holding in a
container w orn or carried by another creature.
• You can retrieve an object in a container worn or
carried by another creature.
• You can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm
traps at range.

You can perform one o f these tasks without being
noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity
(Sleight o f Hand) check contested by the creature’s
Wisdom (Perception) check.
In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by
your Cunning Action to control the hand.
M a g i c a l A m b u s h
Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a
creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has
disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the
spell this turn.
V e r s a t il e T r i c k s t e r
At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with
your mage hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can
designate a creature within 5 feet o f the spectral hand
created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on
attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.
Sp e l l T h ie f
At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically
steal the knowledge o f how to cast a spell from
another spellcaster.
Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets
you or includes you in its area o f effect, you can use your
reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw
with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals
your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the
spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge
o f the spell if it is at least 1st level and o f a level you can
cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell). For the next
8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your
spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the
8 hours have passed.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.
Sorcerer
Golden eyes flashing, a human
stretches out her hand and unleashes
the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
As an inferno rages around her foes,
leathery wings spread from her back and
she takes to the air.
Long hair whipped by a conjured wind,
a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws
his head back. Lifting him momentarily off
the ground, a wave o f magic surges up in him,
through him, and out from him in a mighty blast
o f lightning.
Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a
finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast o f fire springs
from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back
behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her
wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.
Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred
upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly
influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces.
One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any
more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one
chooses sorcery; the power cho o se s the sorcerer.
Magic is a part o f every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind,
and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped.
Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an
ancient bloodline infused with the magic o f dragons.
Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them,
a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.
The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly
unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce
exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other
lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most
o f the time, the talents o f sorcery appear as apparent
flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin o f their
power, while others trace it to strange events in their
own lives. The touch o f a demon, the blessing of a
dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste o f the water from
a mysterious spring might spark the gift o f sorcery.
So too might the gift o f a deity o f magic, exposure
to the elemental forces o f the Inner Planes or the
maddening chaos o f Limbo, or a glimpse into the
inner w orkings o f reality.
Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient
tomes o f magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they
rely on a patron to grant their spells as w arlocks do.
By learning to harness and channel their own inborn
magic, they can discover new and staggering ways
to unleash that power.
U n e x p l a i n e d P o w e r s
Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find
a sorcerer w ho is not involved in the adventuring life
in some way. People with magical power seething in
their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to
stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be w ielded, and
it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if
it isn’t called on.

Sorcerers often
have obscure or quixotic
motivations driving them
to adventure. Some seek a greater
understanding o f the magical force that infuses
them, or the answer to the mystery o f its origin. Others
hope to find a way to get rid o f it, or to unleash its full
potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit
as useful to an adventuring party as w izards, making
up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical
knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the
spells they know.
C r e a t i n g a S o r c e r e r
The most important question to consider when creating
your sorcerer is the origin o f your power. As a starting
character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic
bloodline or the influence o f wild magic, but the exact
source o f your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family
curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or
did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with
inherent magic but perhaps scarred as w ell?
How do you feel about the magical power coursing
through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or
revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or
a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did
you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you
had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you
feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty
purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you
the right to do what you want, to take what you want
from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power
links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey
creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put
a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created
you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to
carry this power.
Q u i c k B u il d
You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second,
choose the hermit background. Third, choose the
light, prestidigitation, ray o f frost, and shocking grasp
cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and
magic missile.
C lass Features
As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.
H it P o in t s
Hit Dice: 1d6 per sorcerer level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your
Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st
P r o f ic ie n c ie s
Armor: None
Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs,
light crossbows
Tools: None
Saving Throws: Constitution, Charisma
Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight,
Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a light c rossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple
weapon
• (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
• (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
• Two daggers
S p e l l c a s t i n g
An event in your past, or in the life o f a parent or
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with
arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin,
fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.
C a n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from
the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer
cantrips o f your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column o f the Sorcerer table.
Sp e l l Sl o t s
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
one o f these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell
slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning
hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.
Spe l l s K n o w n o f 1st L e v e l a n d H ig h e r
You know two 1st-level spells o f your choice from the
sorcerer spell list.
The Spells Known column o f the Sorcerer table
shows when you learn more sorcerer spells o f your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd
level in this class, you can learn one new spell o f 1st
or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one o f the sorcerer spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer
spell list, which also must be o f a level for which you
have spell slots.
Sp e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer
spells, since the power o f your magic relies on your
ability to project your w ill into the world. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Sp e l l c a s t in g F o c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.
S o r c e r o u s O r i g i n
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the
source o f your innate magical power: Draconic
Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end o f the
class description.
Your choice grants you features when you choose it at
1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.
F o n t o f M a g i c
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring o f magic
within yourself. This w ellspring is represented by
sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety o f
magical effects.
S o r c e r y P o in t s
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you
reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points
column o f the Sorcerer table. You can never have
more sorcery points than shown on the table for your
level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you
finish a long rest.
F l e x i b l e C a s t i n g
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell
slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery
points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points
as you reach higher levels.
Creating Spell Slots. You can transform unexpended
sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on
your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost
o f creating a spell slot o f a given level. You can create
spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a
bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell
slot and gain a number o f sorcery points equal to the
slot’s level.
M e t a m a g i c
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells
to suit your needs. You gain two o f the following
Metamagic options o f your choice. You gain another one
at 10th and 17th level.
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell
when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
C a r e f u l Sp e l l
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make
a saving throw, you can protect some o f those creatures
from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery
point and choose a number o f those creatures up to your
Charisma modifier (minimum o f one creature). A chosen
creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw
against the spell.
D i s t a n t S p e l l
When you cast a spell that has a range o f 5 feet or
greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
range o f the spell.
When you cast a spell that has a range o f touch, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range o f the
spell 30 feet.
E m p o w e r e d Sp e l l
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1
sorcery point to reroll a number o f the damage dice up
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must
use the new rolls.
You can use Empowered Spell even if you have
already used a different Metamagic option during the
casting o f the spell.
E x t e n d e d S pe l l
When you cast a spell that has a duration o f 1 minute
or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its
duration, to a maximum duration o f 24 hours.
H e ig h t e n e d S p e l l
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a
saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery
points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its
first saving throw made against the spell.
Q u i c k e n e d Sp e l l
When you cast a spell that has a casting time o f 1 action,
you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting
time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
Su b t l e Sp e l l
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
Tw i n n e d Sp e l l
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and
doesn’t have a range o f self, you can spend a number of
sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second
creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if
the spell is a cantrip).
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
S o r c e r o u s R e s t o r a t i o n
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points
whenever you finish a short rest.
Sorcerous O rigins
Different sorcerers claim different origins for their
innate magic. Although many variations exist, most
o f these origins fall into two categories: a draconic
bloodline and w ild magic.
D r a c o n i c B l o o d l i n e
Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was
mingled with your blood or that o f your ancestors. Most
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times w ho made a
bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed
a dragon parent. Some o f these bloodlines are well
established in the world, but most are obscure. Any
given sorcerer could be the first o f a new bloodline, as a
result o f a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.
D r a g o n A n c e s t o r
At 1st level, you choose one type o f dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon
is used by features you gain later.
D r a c o n i c A n c e s t r y
Dragon Damage Type
Black Acid
Blue Lightning
Brass Fire
Bronze Lightning
Copper Acid
Cold Fire
Green Poison
Red Fire
Silver Cold
White Cold
You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally,
whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it
applies to the check.
D r a c o n i c R e s il ie n c e
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical
traits o f your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level,
your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by
1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
Additionally, parts o f your skin are covered by a thin
sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t w earing
armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
E l e m e n t a l A f f i n i t y
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals
damage o f the type associated with your draconic
ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.
At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain
resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.
D r a g o n W in g s
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
equal to your current speed. You can create these w ings
as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you
dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.
You can’t manifest your w ings while wearing armor
unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and
clothing not made to accommodate your wings might
be destroyed when you manifest them.
D r a c o n ic P r e s e n c e
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread
presence o f your dragon ancestor, causing those around
you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action,
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a
distance o f 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your
concentration (as if you w ere casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this
aura must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be
charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose
fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on
this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.
W i l d M a g i c
Your innate magic comes from the w ild forces of chaos
that underlie the order o f creation. You might have
endured exposure to some form o f raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental
Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke o f your birth, with
no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this
chaotic m agic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
W il d M a g ic Su r g e
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your
spellcasting can unleash surges o f untamed magic.
Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell o f 1st level
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a
1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random
magical effect.
T id e s o f C h a o s
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces o f
chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the
DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table
immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or
higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
B e n d L u c k
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate
using your wild magic. When another creature you can
see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving
throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery
points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You
can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects
o f the roll occur.
C o n t r o l l e d C h a o s
At 14th level, you gain a modicum o f control over the
surges o f your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the
Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use
either number.
Sp e l l B o m b a r d m e n t
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy o f your
spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and
roll the highest number possible on any of the dice,
choose one o f those dice, roll it again and add that roll to
the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

Wa r l o c k
With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young
elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical
charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace
sentinel to his will.
As flames spring to life in her hands, a w izened
human whispers the secret name o f her demonic patron,
infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the
odd alignment of the stars overhead, a w ild-eyed tiefling
chants the mystic ritual that w ill open a doorway to a
distant world.
Warlocks are seekers o f the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric o f the multiverse. Through pacts
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power,
warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of
beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and
alien entities o f the Far Realm, warlocks piece together
arcane secrets to bolster their own power.
Sw o r n a n d B e h o l d e n
A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly
being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock
and patron is like that o f a cleric and a deity, though
the beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are not
gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings
not typically served by c lerics. More often, though, the
arrangement is similar to that between a master and
an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power,
at the cost o f occasional services performed on the
patron’s behalf.
The magic bestowed on a w arlock ranges from minor
but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as
the ability to see in darkness or to read any language)
to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards,
warlocks supplement their magic with some facility
at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light
armor and know how to use simple weapons.
D e l v e r s i n t o S e c r e t s
Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
and power, which compels them into their pacts and
shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are
widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that
are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the w ilds
comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord
or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully
aware o f it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of

forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is
opened to realities beyond the material world and to the
alien beings that dwell in the outer void.
Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge
and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research.
No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or
she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather,
the vast majority o f warlocks spend their days in active
pursuit o f their goals, which typically means some kind
o f adventuring. Furthermore, the demands o f their
patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.
C r e a t i n g a W a r l o c k
As you make your warlock character, spend some time
thinking about your patron and the obligations that
your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the
pact, and how did you make contact with your patron?
Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you
seek out the ritual that w ould allow you to make contact
with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron,
or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe
under the obligations o f your pact or serve joyfully in
anticipation o f the rewards promised to you?
Work with your DM to determine how big a part your
pact w ill play in your character’s adventuring career.
Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures,
or they might consist entirely o f small favors you can do
between adventures.
What kind o f relationship do you have with your
patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic?
How important does your patron consider you to be?
What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you
know other servants o f your patron?
How does your patron communicate with you? If
you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with
your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages
from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea
leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the
warlock can see. Other w arlocks converse with their
patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with
intermediaries.
Q u i c k B u i l d
You can make a w arlock quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose
the charlatan background. Third, choose the eldritch
blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level
spells ray o f sickness and witch bolt.
C lass Features
As a warlock, you gain the following class features.
H i t P o in t s
Hit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st
P r o f ic ie n c ie s
Armor: Light armor
Weapons: Simple weapons
Tools: None
Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma
Skills: Choose two skills from Arcana,
Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation,
Nature, and Religion
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a light c rossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple
weapon
• (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
• (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack
• Leather armor, any simple w eapon, and two daggers
O t h e r w o r l d l y Pa t r o n
At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an
otherworldly being o f your choice: the Archfey, the
Fiend, or the Great Old One, each o f which is detailed
at the end o f the class description. Your choice
grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level.
Pa c t M a g i c
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you
by your patron have given you facility with spells. See
chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and
chapter 11 for the w arlock spell list.
C a n t r i p s
You know two cantrips o f your choice from the w arlock
spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column o f the Warlock table.
Sp e l l Sl o t s
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have.
The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all
o f your spell slots are the same level. To cast one o f your
warlock spells o f 1st level or higher, you must expend a
spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a short or long rest.
For example, when you are 5th level, you have
two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell
thunderwave, you must spend one o f those slots, and
you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
Sp e l l s K n o w n o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H ig h e r
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells o f your choice
from the w arlock spell list.
The Spells Known column o f the W arlock table shows
when you learn more w arlock spells o f your choice o f 1st
level and higher. A spell you choose must be o f a level
no higher than what’s shown in the table's Slot Level
column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for
example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be
1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one o f the warlock spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the warlock
spell list, which also must be o f a level for which you
have spell slots.
Sp e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your w arlock
spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a w arlock spell you cast and when making an attack
roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier
Sp e l l c a s t in g Fo c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your w arlock spells.
E l d r i t c h I n v o c a t i o n s
In your study o f occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch
invocations, fragments o f forbidden knowledge that
imbue you with an abiding magical ability.
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your
choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end
o f the class description. When you gain certain w arlock
levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice,
as shown in the Invocations Known column o f the
Warlock table.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one o f the invocations you know and
replace it with another invocation that you could learn
at that level.
Pa c t B o o n
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift
upon you for your loyal service. You gain one o f the
following features o f your choice.
Pa c t o f t h e C h a in
You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a
ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of
spells known.
When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the
normal forms for your familiar or one o f the following
special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can
forgo one o f your own attacks to allow your familiar to
make one attack o f its own.
Pa c t o f t h e B l a d e
You can use your action to create a pact w eapon in your
empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee
weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for
weapon options). You are proficient with it while you
wield it. This w eapon counts as magical for the purpose
o f overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
attacks and damage.
Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet
away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears
if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the w eapon
(no action required), or if you die.
You can transform one magic w eapon into your pact
weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold
the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course
o f 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you
create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an
artifact or a sentient w eapon in this way. The weapon
ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform
the 1-hour ritual on a different w eapon, or if you use
a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon
appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space
when the bond breaks.
Pa c t o f t h e T o m e
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of
Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three
cantrips from any class’s spell list. While the book is on
your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They
don’t count against your number of cantrips known.
If you lose your Book o f Shadows, you can perform
a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your
patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short
or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
turns to ash when you die.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability s cores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
M y s t i c A r c a n u m
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical
secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell
from the w arlock spell list as this arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without
expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before
you can do so again.
At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells o f your
choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell
at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one
9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your
Mystic A rcanum when you finish a long rest.
E l d r i t c h M a s t e r
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of
mystical power while entreating your patron to regain
expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating
your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots
from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots
with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you
can do so again.
Yo u r Pa c t B o o n
Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an
object that reflects your patron’s nature.
Pact o f the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a
typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your
patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey
and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old
One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.
Pact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your
weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines.
If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made
of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your
patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an
ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its
head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.
Pact o f the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine,
gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion,
gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome
bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of
conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister
regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the
tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the
Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own
burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.
O t h e rw o r ld ly P a tron s
The beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are
mighty inhabitants o f other planes o f existence—not
gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons
give their w arlocks access to different powers and
invocations, and expect significant favors in return.
Some patrons collect w arlocks, doling out mystic
knowledge relatively freely or boasting o f their ability
to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their
power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron
might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.
T h e A r c h f e y
Your patron is a lord or lady o f the fey, a creature of
legend who holds secrets that w ere forgotten before
the mortal races w ere born. This being’s motivations
are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and
might involve a striving for greater magical power or the
settling o f age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include
the Prince o f Frost; the Queen o f Air and Darkness,
ruler o f the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer
Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam,
the Prince o f Fools; and ancient hags.
E x p a n d e d Sp e l l L is t
The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following
spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.
A r c h f e y E x p a n d e d S p e l l s
Spell Level Spells
1st faerie fire, sleep
2nd calm emotions, phantasmal force
3rd blink, plant growth
4th dominate beast, greater invisibility
5th dominate person, seeming
F e y P r e s e n c e
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the
ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence
o f the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in
a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom
saving throw against your w arlock spell save DC. The
creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed
or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of
your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
M i s t y E s c a p e
Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff o f mist in
response to harm. When you take damage, you can use
your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet
to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible
until the start o f your next turn or until you attack or
cast a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
B e g u i l in g D e f e n s e s
Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to
turn the mind-affecting magic o f your enemies against
them. You are immune to being charmed, and when
another creature attempts to charm you, you can use
your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on
that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or
be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature
takes any damage.
D a r k D e l ir iu m
Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into
an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature
that you can see within 60 feet o f you. It must make a
Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save
DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you
(your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration
is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This
effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.
Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost
in a misty realm, the appearance o f which you choose.
The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and
the illusion.
You must finish a short or long rest before you can
use this feature again.
T h e F i e n d
You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower
planes o f existence, a being w hose aims are evil,
even if you strive against those aims. Such beings
desire the corruption or destruction of all things,
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to
forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon,
Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such
as A smodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial;
pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and
ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.
E x p a n d e d Sp e l l L is t
The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a w arlock spell. The following
spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
F i e n d E x p a n d e d S p e l l s
Spell Level Spells
1st burning hands, command
2nd blindness/deafness, scorching ray
3rd fireball, stinking cloud
4th fire shield, wall o f fire
5th flame strike, hallow
D a r k O n e ’s B l e s s in g
Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature
to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your
Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum o f 1).
D a r k O n e ’s O w n L u c k
Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter
fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a
saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d 10 to
your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but
before any o f the roll’s effects occur.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
F ie n d i s h R e s il ie n c e
Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type
when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance
to that damage type until you choose a different one
with this feature. Damage from magical w eapons or
silver weapons ignores this resistance.
H u r l T h r o u g h H e l l
Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an
attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport
the target through the lower planes. The creature
disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
At the end o f your next turn, the target returns to the
space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied
space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d 10 psychic
damage as it reels from its horrific experience.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.
T h e G r e a t O l d O n e
Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is
utterly foreign to the fabric o f reality. It might come from
the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be
one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives
are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so
immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries
pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The
Great Old One might be unaware o f your existence
or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have
learned allow you to draw your magic from it.
Entities o f this type include Ghaunadar, called That
Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the
Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu;
and other unfathomable beings.
E x p a n d e d Sp e l l L is t
The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list
o f spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following
spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.
G r e a t O l d O n e E x p a n d e d S p e l l s
Spell Level Spells
1st dissonant whispers, Tasha's hideous laughter
2nd detect thoughts, phantasmal force
3rd clairvoyance, sending
4th dominate beast, Evard’s black tentacles
5th dominate person, telekinesis
A w a k e n e d M in d
Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you
the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You
can communicate telepathically with any creature you
can see within 30 feet o f you. You don’t need to share
a language with the creature for it to understand your
telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to
understand at least one language.
E n t r o p i c W a r d
At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against
attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good
luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack
roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose
disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your
next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you
make it before the end o f your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
T h o u g h t Sh i e l d
Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by
telepathy or other m eans unless you allow it. You also
have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a
creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature
takes the same amount o f damage that you do.
C r e a t e T h r a l l
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s
mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use
your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That
creature is then charmed by you until a remove curse
spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed
from it, or you use this feature again.
You can communicate telepathically with the charmed
creature as long as the two o f you are on the same plane
o f existence.
Eldritch Invoc a t io n s
If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must
meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the
same time that you meet its prerequisites.

B o o k o f A n c i e n t Se c r e t s
Prerequisite: Pact o f the Tome feature
You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book o f
Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the
ritual tag from any class’s spell list. The spells appear
in the book and don’t count against the number o f spells
you know. With your Book o f Shadows in hand, you
can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the
spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by
some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell
you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to
your Book o f Shadows. When you find such a spell, you
can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or
less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you
can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level
o f the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and
costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
C h a in s o f C a r c e r i

G a z e o f T w o M in d s
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid
and perceive through its senses until the end o f your
next turn. As long as the creature is on the same
plane o f existence as you, you can use your action
on subsequent turns to maintain this connection,
extending the duration until the end of your next turn.
While perceiving through the other creature’s senses,
you benefit from any special senses possessed by that
creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own
surroundings.

W izard
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions o f the
battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving
in front o f her, she completes her spell and launches a
tiny bead o f fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.
Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a
long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
bringing a whiff o f brimstone from the otherworldly
plane beyond.
Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a
gnome tosses a handful o f small bones inscribed with
mystic symbols, muttering a few words o f power over
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
passage to his left.
Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave o f magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
spells o f explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes o f existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
spells change one substance into another, call meteors
down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
S c h o l a r s o f t h e A r c a n e
Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the
power o f magic draws students who seek to master
its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods,
shaping reality itself. Though the casting o f a typical
spell requires merely the utterance o f a few strange
words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or
clump o f exotic materials, these surface components
barely hint at the expertise attained after years of
apprenticeship and countless hours o f study.
Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else
is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment
and grow in experience. They can also learn them from
other w izards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions,
and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are
steeped in magic.
T h e L u r e o f K n o w l e d g e
Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a
wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching
others the secrets o f the multiverse. Other wizards sell
their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or
pursue lives o f crime or domination.
But the lure o f knowledge and power calls even the
most unadventurous wizards out o f the safety o f their
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and
lost cities. Most w izards believe that their counterparts
in ancient civilizations knew secrets o f magic that have
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets
could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic
available in the present age.
C r e a t i n g a W i z a r d __________
Creating a w izard character demands a backstory
dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How
did your character first come into contact with magic?
How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do
you have a natural talent, or did you simply study
hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a
magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the
basics o f magic?
What drew you forth from your life o f study? Did your
first taste o f magical knowledge leave you hungry for
more? Have you received word o f a secret repository
of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?
Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound
magical skills to the test in the face o f danger.
Q u i c k B u i l d
You can make a w izard quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest
ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity.
If you plan to join the School o f Enchantment, make
Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the sage
background. Third, choose the mage hand, light, and
ray o f frost cantrips, along with the following 1st-level
spells for your spellbook: burning hands, charm person,
feather fall, mage armor, magic missile, and sleep.

E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to
the equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
• (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
• (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
• A spellbook
S p e l l c a s t i n g
As a student o f arcane magic, you have a spellbook
containing spells that show the first glimmerings of
your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the w izard spell list.
C a n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know three cantrips o f your choice
from the wizard spell list. You learn additional w izard
cantrips o f your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.
Y o u r S p e l l b o o k
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels
reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well
as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature
of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in
an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an
ancient library.
Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell
of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is
of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare
the time to decipher and copy it.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You
must practice the spell until you understand the sounds
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook
using your own notation.
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well
as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent
this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your
other spells.
Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own
spellbook into another book—for example, if you want
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like
copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier,
since you understand your own notation and already know
how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp
for each level o f the copied spell.
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure
to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new
spellbook. Filling out the remainder o f your spellbook
requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this
reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique
compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume
that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound
gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a
loose collection o f notes scrounged together after you lost
your previous spellbook in a mishap.
Sp e l l b o o k
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level
wizard spells o f your choice.
P r e p a r in g a n d C a s t in g Sp e l l s
The W izard table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list o f wizard spells that are available
for you to cast. To do so. choose a number o f wizard
spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level (minimum o f one spell). The
spells must be o f a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an
Intelligence o f 16, your list o f prepared spells can
include six spells o f 1st or 2nd level, in any combination,
chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from
your list o f prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f wizard
spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and
memorizing the incantations and gestures you must
make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level
for each spell on your list.
Sp e l l c a s t in g A b i l i t y
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard
spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated
study and memorization. You use your Intelligence
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your intelligence modifier
R i t u a l C a s t in g
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.
You don't need to have the spell prepared.
S p e l l c a s t in g F o c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your w izard spells.
L e a r n in g Sp e l l s o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H ig h e r
Each time you gain a w izard level, you can add two
wizard spells o f your choice to your spellbook. Each
o f these spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your
adventures, you might find other spells that you can add
to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).
A r c a n e R e c o v e r y
You have learned to regain some o f your magical energy
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you
finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots
to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that
is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded
up), and none o f the slots can be 6th level or higher.
For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover
up to two levels worth o f spell slots. You can recover either
a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
A r c a n e T r a d i t i o n
When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane
tradition, shaping your practice o f magic through one
o f eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination,
Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy,
or Transmutation, all detailed at the end o f the
class description.
Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability s cores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
S p e l l M a s t e r y
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over
certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a
1st-level w izard spell and a 2nd-level w izard spell that
are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their
lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a
higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one
or both o f the spells you chose for different spells of
the same levels.
S i g n a t u r e S p e l l s
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.
Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook
as your signature spells. You always have these spells
prepared, they don’t count against the number o f spells
you have prepared, and you can cast each o f them once at
3rd level without expending a spell slot. W hen you do so,
you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you
must expend a spell slot as normal.
A rcane T raditions
The study o f wizardry is ancient, stretching back to
the earliest mortal discoveries o f magic. It is firmly
established in the worlds o f D&D, with various
traditions dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse
revolve around the schools o f magic. Wizards through
the ages have cataloged thousands o f spells, grouping
them into eight categories called schools, as described
in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are
literally schools; a w izard might study at the School o f
Illusion while another studies across town at the School
o f Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are
more like academic departments, with rival faculties
competing for students and funding. Even w izards who
train apprentices in the solitude o f their own towers use
the division of magic into schools as a learning device,
since the spells o f each school require mastery o f
different techniques.
S c h o o l o f A b j u r a t i o n
The School o f Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks,
banishes, or protects. Detractors o f this school say
that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than
positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending
harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil
influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a
proud and respected vocation.
Called abjurers, members o f this school are sought
when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important
locations must be guarded against magical spying, and
when portals to other planes o f existence must be closed.
A b j u r a t io n Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration
spell into your spellbook is halved.
A r c a n e W a r d
Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around
yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration
spell o f 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a
strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on
yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward
has hit points equal to twice your w izard level + your
Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the
ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces
the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.
While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb
damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an
abjuration spell o f 1st level or higher, the ward regains a
number o f hit points equal to twice the level o f the spell.
Once you create the ward, you can't create it again
until you finish a long rest.
P r o j e c t e d W a r d
Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see
within 30 feet o f you takes damage, you can use your
reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that
damage. If this damage reduces the w ard to 0 hit points,
the warded creature takes any remaining damage.
Im p r o v e d A b j u r a t io n
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration
spell that requires you to make an ability check as
a part o f casting that spell (as in counterspell and
dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that
ability check.
S p e l l R e s is t a n c e
Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving
throws against spells.
Furthermore, you have resistance against the
damage o f spells.
S c h o o l o f C o n j u r a t i o n
As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects
and creatures out o f thin air. You can conjure billowing
clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from
elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery
grows, you learn spells o f transportation and can
teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other
planes o f existence, in an instant.
C o n j u r a t io n Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell
into your spellbook is halved.
M in o r C o n j u r a t io n
Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you
can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object
in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space
that you can see within 10 feet o f you. This object can be
no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than
10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical
object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical,
radiating dim light out to 5 feet.
The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this
feature again, or if it takes any damage.
B e n ig n T r a n s p o s i t io n
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range
that is occupied by a Small or M edium creature. If that
creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of
1st level or higher.
F o c u s e d C o n j u r a t io n
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on
a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken
as a result o f taking damage.
D u r a b l e Su m m o n s
Starting at 14th level, any creature that you
summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30
temporary hit points.
S c h o o l o f D i v i n a t i o n
The counsel o f a diviner is sought by royalty and
commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding
o f the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive
to part the veils o f space, time, and consciousness so
that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge,
and foresight.
D i v in a t io n Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell
into your spellbook is halved.
P o r t e n t
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school,
glimpses o f the future begin to press in on your
awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s
and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any
attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or
a creature that you can see with one o f these foretelling
rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you
can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you
finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
E x p e r t D i v in a t io n
Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes
so easily to you that it expends only a fraction o f your
spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell
o f 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one
expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be o f a
level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher
than 5th level.
T h e T h ir d Ey e
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to
increase your powers o f perception. When you do so,
choose one o f the following benefits, which lasts until
you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest.
You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.
Darkvision. You gain darkvision out to a range o f 60
feet, as described in chapter 8.
Ethereal Sight. You can see into the Ethereal Plane
within 60 feet o f you.
Greater Comprehension. You can read any language.
See Invisibility. You can see invisible creatures and
objects within 10 feet o f you that are within line o f sight.
G r e a t e r P o r t e n t
Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams
intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind
o f what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent
feature, rather than two.
S c h o o l o f E n c h a n t m e n t
As a member o f the School o f Enchantment, you have
honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile
other people and monsters. Some enchanters are
peacemakers w ho bewitch the violent to lay down their
arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others
are tyrants w ho magically bind the unwilling into their
service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.
E n c h a n t m e n t Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment
spell into your spellbook is halved.
H y p n o t i c G a z e
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your
soft w ords and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall
another creature. A s an action, choose one creature that
you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or
hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you
until the end o f your next turn. The charmed creature’s
speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and
visibly dazed.
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
maintain this effect, extending its duration until the
end o f your next turn. However, the effect ends if you
move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the
creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature
takes damage.
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its
initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this
feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
I n s t in c t iv e C h a r m
Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see
within 30 feet o f you makes an attack roll against
you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack,
provided that another creature is within the attack’s
range. The attacker must make a W isdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save,
the attacker must target the creature that is closest
to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures
are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.
On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the
attacker again until you finish a long rest.
You must choose to use this feature before knowing
whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can’t
be charmed are immune to this effect.
Sp l i t E n c h a n t m e n t
Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment
spell o f 1st level or higher that targets only one creature,
you can have it target a second creature.
A l t e r M e m o r ie s
At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature
unaware o f your magical influence on it. When you cast
an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures,
you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it
remains unaware o f being charmed.
Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can
use your action to try to make the chosen creature
forget some o f the time it spent charmed. The creature
must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against
your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours
o f its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier
(minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less
time, and the amount o f time can’t exceed the duration
of your enchantment spell.
S c h o o l o f E v o c a t i o n
You focus your study on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid.
Some evokers find employment in military forces,
serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar.
Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak,
while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers,
or aspiring tyrants.
Ev o c a t io n Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell
into your spellbook is halved.
S c u l p t Sp e l l s
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of
relative safety within the effects o f your evocation spells.
When you cast an evocation spell that affects other
creatures that you can see, you can choose a number
of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen
creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws
against the spell, and they take no damage if they would
normally take half damage on a successful save.
P o t e n t C a n t r i p
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect
even creatures that avoid the brunt o f the effect. When
a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your
cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if
any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.
E m p o w e r e d Ev o c a t io n
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence
modifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation
spell you cast.
O v e r c h a n n e l
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of
your simpler spells. When you cast a w izard spell of
5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal
maximum damage with that spell.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect.
If you use this feature again before you finish a long
rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of
the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you
use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d 12. This
damage ignores resistance and immunity.
S c h o o l o f I l l u s i o n
You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the
senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest
folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by
your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some
illusionists—including many gnome w izards—are
benign tricksters w ho use their spells to entertain.
Others are more sinister masters o f deception, using
their illusions to frighten and fool others for their
personal gain.
I l l u s io n Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell
into your spellbook is halved.
I m p r o v e d M in o r I l l u s io n
When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn
the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this
cantrip, you learn a different w izard cantrip o f your
choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number
of cantrips known.
When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a
sound and an image with a single casting o f the spell.
M a l l e a b l e I l l u s io n s
Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that
has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your
action to change the nature o f that illusion (using the
spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that
you can see the illusion.
I l l u s o r y S e l f
Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory
duplicate o f yourself as an instant, almost instinctual
reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack
roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose
the illusory duplicate between the attacker and
yourself. The attack automatically m isses you, then the
illusion dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
I l l u s o r y R e a l i t y
By 14th level, you have learned the secret o f weaving
shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality.
When you cast an illusion spell o f 1st level or
higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical
object that is part o f the illusion and make that object
real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for
1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion o f a
bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough
for your allies to cross.
The object can’t deal damage or otherwise
directly harm anyone.
S c h o o l o f N e c r o m a n c y
The School o f Necromancy explores the cosmic forces
o f life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in
this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that
animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to
sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys
its body, transforming that vital energy into magical
power you can manipulate.
Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even
villainous, due to the close association with death.
Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they
manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.
N e c r o m a n c y Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy
spell into your spellbook is halved.
G r im H a r v e s t
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from
creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when
you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level
or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s
level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the
School o f Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for
killing constructs or undead.
U n d e a d T h r a l l s
At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your
spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast
animate dead, you can target one additional corpse
or pile o f bones, creating another zombie or skeleton,
as appropriate.
Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy
spell, it has additional benefits:
• The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an
amount equal to your w izard level.
• The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its
weapon damage rolls.
I n u r e d t o U n d e a t h
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic
damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced.
You have spent so much time dealing with undead and
the forces that animate them that you have become
inured to some of their worst effects.
C o m m a n d U n d e a d
Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring
undead under your control, even those created by other
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that
you can see within 60 feet o f you. That creature must
make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard
spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature
on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and
obeys your commands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.
If the target has an Intelligence o f 8 or higher, it has
advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving
throw and has an Intelligence o f 12 or higher, it can
repeat the saving throw at the end o f every hour until it
succeeds and breaks free.
S c h o o l o f T r a n s m u t a t i o n
You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter.
To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently
mutable, and you delight in being an agent o f change.
You wield the raw stuff o f creation and learn to alter both
physical forms and mental qualities. Your m agic gives
you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.
Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters,
turning people into toads and transforming copper into
silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their
magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the
power o f the gods to make and destroy worlds.
T r a n s m u t a t io n Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation
spell into your spellbook is halved.
M in o r A l c h e m y
Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you
can temporarily alter the physical properties o f one
nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into
another. You perform a special alchemical procedure
on one object composed entirely o f wood, stone (but not
a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into
a different one o f those materials. For each 10 minutes
you spend performing the procedure, you can transform
up to 1 cubic foot o f material. After 1 hour, or until you
lose your concentration (as if you w ere concentrating on
a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
T r a n s m u t e r ’s St o n e
Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a
transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You
can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another
creature. A creature gains a benefit o f your choice
as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession.
When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the
following options:
• Darkvision out to a range o f 60 feet, as described in
chapter 8
• An increase to speed o f 10 feet while the creature is
unencumbered
• Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
• Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder
damage (your choice whenever you choose this
benefit)
Each time you cast a transmutation spell o f 1st level
or higher, you can change the effect o f your stone if the
stone is on your person.
If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous
one ceases to function.
Sh a p e c h a n g e r
At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your
spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast
polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you
do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a
beast w hose challenge rating is 1 or lower.
Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest, though you
can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
M a s t e r T r a n s m u t e r
Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to
consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored
within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When
you do so, choose one o f the following effects. Your
transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade
until you finish a long rest.
Major Transformation. You can transmute one
nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into
another nonmagical object o f similar size and mass and
o f equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes
handling the object to transform it.
Panacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons
affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s
stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
Restore Life. You cast the raise dead spell on a
creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without
expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in
your spellbook.
Restore Youth. You touch the transmuter’s stone to
a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is
reduced by 3 d 10 years, to a minimum o f 13 years. This
effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.
