The DM Helper will act as your in-game assistance, taking care of the administrative tasks and allowing you to focus on your players, the narrative and the fun!

# First Steps
This tutorial will guide you through creating your first campaign (in this case the example campaing), using the interface and setting up your world to run your game in.

## Download and install
Get the latest copy of DMHelper from our [itch.io](https://dm-helper.itch.io/dm-helper) page.<br />
Unpack the archive to an destination of your choosing. Keep in mind that you might want to put some files (like maps and character portraits) in the same location. If kept in different folders, it is a little bit less likely to accidentaly delete some files of your campaign if you do an update.<br />
* [MyCampaigns]
 * [DMHelper]
 * [Campaign ONE]
      CampaignOne.xml
   * [Portraits]

   * [Maps]

There are no more installation steps neccessary. Just start DMHelper.example

## First run
When DMHelper is started for the first time, you can open a bestiary.xml. This file will include a database with lots of monsters, statblocks and images, for easy use within DMHelper.  
![Select bestiary dialog](Images/bestiary.jpg)  
This step is skippable and the bestiary can be imported later.
After skipping, or importing, a bestiary, the main interface will be opened.

## Empty campaign
First of all, a new campaign has to be created or opened. Hit _File_ to see your options.  
![Interface](Images/interface_01.jpg)  
If there is no recent campaign to open, the options are opening the example campaign, or creating a new one.  Just hit _New Campaign_ or _Ctrl+N_ to open a dialog for creation. There the name of the new campaign can be set. I'll use _DMHelper Realm_ for this example.  
![Create new campaign](Images/interface_02.jpg)  
Hit okay, then the DMHelper interface will be active and we can start adding our first content.
